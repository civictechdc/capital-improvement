This project will facilitate the relocation of the OCTO data centers to sites that are more secure, have robust infrastructure, and have sufficient capacity to meet current and future needs. The scope of the project is to find and prepare suitable data center sites, relocate the services to those sites, and support necessary capital improvements. One data center will be moved to a District-owned, recently constructed, highly secure site at the Unified Communications Center (UCC). The other data center will be moved to a state-of–the-art leased facility outside of the District of Columbia. Doing so will eliminate current issues with space and power capacity, as well as improve the District’s disaster recovery capability.","justification":"see N2501C","progress_assessment":"see N2501C","related_projects":"N9001-DC Government New Data Center Build-out, N2501C-Data Center Relocation","milestones":{"environmental_approvals":{},"design_start":{"projected":"10/01/08","actual":"10/01/08"},"design_complete":{"projected":"09/30/10","actual":"09/30/10"},"construction_start":{"projected":"09/30/09","actual":"08/17/09"},"construction_complete":{"projected":"09/30/15"},"closeout":{"projected":"09/30/15"}},"est_cost":7240000,"useful_life":15,"lat":38.8537276,"lon":-76.99504482,"first_year":2014,"last_year":2015,"cip_history":{"FY2014":{"plan":{"FY2014":650,"FY2015":500,"FY2016":0,"FY2017":0,"FY2018":0,"FY2019":0},"est_cost":4904000},"FY2015":{"plan":{"FY2015":500,"FY2016":0,"FY2017":0,"FY2018":0,"FY2019":0,"FY2020":0},"est_cost":7240000}},"cumulative_funding":{"funding_by_phase":{"(05) Equipment":{"FY2014":{"allotted":3754,"spent":3754,"proposed":650},"FY2015":{"allotted":6740,"spent":5238,"proposed":500}}},"funding_by_source":{"GO Bonds - New (0300)":{"FY2014":{"allotted":3754,"spent":3754,"proposed":650},"FY2015":{"allotted":6740,"spent":5238,"proposed":500}}},"total_funding":{"FY2014":{"allotted":3754,"spent":3754,"proposed":650},"FY2015":{"allotted":6740,"spent":5238,"proposed":500}}}}
