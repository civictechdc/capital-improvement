The addition will house a “Gymatorium”, Cafeteria, four additional classrooms, a media center, and administration offices and building service space (i.e. additional bathrooms, custodial and circulation space). This project will include some interior re-programming of the Addison building to complement the program within the Addition and Hyde. Site work will be directed at conserving the existing quantity of parking spaces. Existing playground areas will be replaced above the underground portion of the addition. Due to the historic significance of the school and surrounding neighborhood, this project required presentation and approval of the proposed design by the Old Georgetown Board (OGB), the Commission on Fine Arts (CFA), and State Office of Historic Preservation (SHPO).","justification":"This project was included in the Master Facilities Plan adopted by Section 4111 of the Fiscal Year 2011 Budget Support Act of 2010.
