The goal is to transform those communities into viable places for existing and new residents to live, work, learn and recreate in a safe, healthy, and pleasant environment.  Barry Farm/Park Chester/Wade Road is one of four New Communities sites in the District.  The physical area will be redeveloped into a mixed-use, mixed-income community with an estimated 1,391 new on-site and off-site housing units, retail, office space, a new recreational facility, and a new school.  DMPED is utilizing New Communities capital funds to facilitate development of approximately 654 on-site and off-site replacement housing units as part of this revitalization effort. The replacement units will be affordable to existing Barry Farm public housing residents who pay no more than 30% of their income for housing and residents of other publicly-assisted housing in the revitalization area who pay no more than 30% of their income for housing.","justification":"These funds are needed to assist with the capital activities required to undertake a comprehensive redevelopment of this area plagued by high crime, high poverty and aging public housing.  Capital funds make up a small amount of the total development budget for this project; however, the capital funds are necessary in order to leverage the other financing tools that are needed and which the District plans to pursue such as private capital, bond financing, tax credits, land and other equity.","progress_assessment":"The project is on track and is delivering off-site replacement housing properties.","related_projects":"EB001C-TEMPLE COURTS/NW1 REDEVELOPMENT; EB008C-NEW COMMUNITIES; EB009C-4800 C STREET SE; EB010C-4427 HAYES STREET NE; EB011C-5201 HAYES STREET NE; EB012C-33 K STREET NW; EB013C-BARRY FARM, PARK CHESTER, WADE ROAD; EB015C-LINCOLN HEIGHTS, RICHARDSON DWELLINGS; EB016C-PARK MORTON REDEVELOPMENT INITIATIVE","milestones":{"environmental_approvals":{"projected":"10/01/06"},"design_start":{"projected":"10/01/06"},"design_complete":{"projected":"10/01/10"},"construction_start":{"projected":"10/01/11"},"construction_complete":{"projected":"10/01/16"},"closeout":{"projected":"10/01/16"}},"useful_life":30,"facility":"NEW COMMUNITIES","est_cost":34247000,"lat":38.86032509,"lon":-76.99630335,"first_year":2010,"last_year":2015,"cip_history":{"FY2010":{"plan":{"FY2010":0,"FY2011":1000,"FY2012":1000,"FY2013":2000,"FY2014":0,"FY2015":0},"est_cost":null},"FY2011":{"plan":{"FY2011":0,"FY2012":0,"FY2013":0,"FY2014":0,"FY2015":0,"FY2016":2000},"est_cost":null},"FY2012":{"plan":{"FY2012":0,"FY2013":0,"FY2014":0,"FY2015":0,"FY2016":2000,"FY2017":0},"est_cost":550000000},"FY2013":{"plan":{"FY2013":0,"FY2014":0,"FY2015":0,"FY2016":2000,"FY2017":0,"FY2018":0},"est_cost":18247000},"FY2014":{"plan":{"FY2014":0,"FY2015":2000,"FY2016":0,"FY2017":0,"FY2018":0,"FY2019":0},"est_cost":34247000},"FY2015":{"plan":{"FY2015":2000,"FY2016":0,"FY2017":0,"FY2018":0,"FY2019":0,"FY2020":0},"est_cost":34247000}},"cumulative_funding":{"funding_by_phase":{"(03) Project Management":{"FY2010":{"allotted":0,"spent":0,"proposed":0},"FY2011":{"allotted":0,"spent":0,"proposed":0}},"(04) Construction":{"FY2010":{"allotted":1250,"spent":14,"proposed":0},"FY2011":{"allotted":9250,"spent":4302,"proposed":0},"FY2012":{"allotted":11964,"spent":4295,"proposed":0},"FY2013":{"allotted":16247,"spent":12486,"proposed":0},"FY2014":{"allotted":32247,"spent":32223,"proposed":0},"FY2015":{"allotted":32247,"spent":31268,"proposed":2000}}},"funding_by_source":{"GO Bonds - New (0300)":{"FY2010":{"allotted":1250,"spent":14,"proposed":0},"FY2011":{"allotted":1250,"spent":302,"proposed":0},"FY2012":{"allotted":1250,"spent":295,"proposed":0},"FY2013":{"allotted":1250,"spent":295,"proposed":0},"FY2014":{"allotted":1250,"spent":1250,"proposed":0},"FY2015":{"allotted":1250,"spent":295,"proposed":2000}},"HPTF Revenue Bond Funded (3425)":{"FY2011":{"allotted":8000,"spent":4000,"proposed":0},"FY2012":{"allotted":10714,"spent":4000,"proposed":0},"FY2013":{"allotted":14997,"spent":12191,"proposed":0},"FY2014":{"allotted":30997,"spent":30973,"proposed":0},"FY2015":{"allotted":30997,"spent":30973,"proposed":0}}},"total_funding":{"FY2010":{"allotted":1250,"spent":14,"proposed":0},"FY2011":{"allotted":9250,"spent":4302,"proposed":0},"FY2012":{"allotted":11964,"spent":4295,"proposed":0},"FY2013":{"allotted":16247,"spent":12486,"proposed":0},"FY2014":{"allotted":32247,"spent":32223,"proposed":0},"FY2015":{"allotted":32247,"spent":31268,"proposed":2000}}}}
