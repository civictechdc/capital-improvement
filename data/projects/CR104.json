Additionally, the water supply to the facility has been extremely problematic.  The main booster pumps are at the end of their useful life and no filters, softeners or strainers are installed on the system. All work that was part of the original contract has been completed.  However, in order for the sytem to perform in accordance with the design parameters and deliver the requisite amount of air in the cellblocks, additional fine tuning is necessary; four large rooftop duct fittings need to be replaced, transitions from the large rooftop units need to be modified and final air and water balancing needs to be done for the system to work properly.  Chiller, steam station and associated piping overhaul is also included.","justification":"Air handling units serving the cellblocks are located in the respective mechanical rooms, which are very congested and in an extremely dilapidated state.  All old HVAC equipment and the pneumatic controls have not really worked in years without constant trouble and attention.  That caused the air quality in the jail, including CO2 levels, air flow, air temperature and humidity to go beyond acceptable levels. This project aligns with SustainableDC Action: Energy 1.4.","progress_assessment":"On-going project.","related_projects":"N/A","milestones":{"environmental_approvals":{},"design_start":{},"design_complete":{},"construction_start":{"projected":"04/02/01","actual":"04/02/01"},"construction_complete":{"projected":"10/31/14"},"closeout":{}},"est_cost":17306000,"useful_life":10,"lat":38.88343091,"lon":-76.97637892,"first_year":2012,"last_year":2014,"cip_history":{"FY2012":{"plan":{"FY2012":900,"FY2013":700,"FY2014":0,"FY2015":0,"FY2016":0,"FY2017":0},"est_cost":0},"FY2013":{"plan":{"FY2013":700,"FY2014":5600,"FY2015":0,"FY2016":0,"FY2017":0,"FY2018":0},"est_cost":17000000},"FY2014":{"plan":{"FY2014":5600,"FY2015":0,"FY2016":0,"FY2017":0,"FY2018":0,"FY2019":0},"est_cost":17306000}},"cumulative_funding":{"funding_by_phase":{"(01) Design":{"FY2012":{"allotted":530,"spent":516,"proposed":0},"FY2013":{"allotted":923,"spent":599,"proposed":0},"FY2014":{"allotted":923,"spent":669,"proposed":360}},"(03) Project Management":{"FY2012":{"allotted":545,"spent":428,"proposed":900},"FY2013":{"allotted":528,"spent":428,"proposed":700},"FY2014":{"allotted":1228,"spent":428,"proposed":5240}},"(04) Construction":{"FY2012":{"allotted":8789,"spent":8575,"proposed":0},"FY2013":{"allotted":9313,"spent":8953,"proposed":0},"FY2014":{"allotted":9555,"spent":9546,"proposed":0}}},"funding_by_source":{"GO Bonds - New (0300)":{"FY2012":{"allotted":9864,"spent":9520,"proposed":900},"FY2013":{"allotted":10764,"spent":9980,"proposed":700},"FY2014":{"allotted":11706,"spent":10643,"proposed":5600}}},"total_funding":{"FY2012":{"allotted":9864,"spent":9519,"proposed":900},"FY2013":{"allotted":10764,"spent":9980,"proposed":700},"FY2014":{"allotted":11706,"spent":10643,"proposed":5600}}}}
