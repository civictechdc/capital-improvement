Because of its small size, it only supports a day care center. However, the neighborhood in this area is undergoing a residential revival and the existing facility is insufficient to support the recreational needs of the growing community. Renovation and/or replacement of the existing facility will provide greater recreational amenities for District taxpayers. This project is consistent with the Mayor’s objectives to preserve and enhance the District’s public open spaces, athletic fields, and landscaped parks, as well as to promote recreational opportunities for all age groups that enhance physical, social, and cultural development.","progress_assessment":"None.","related_projects":"none","milestones":{"environmental_approvals":{},"design_start":{"projected":"04/30/13"},"design_complete":{"projected":"10/30/13","actual":"10/30/13"},"construction_start":{},"construction_complete":{},"closeout":{}},"useful_life":20,"facility":"NEW YORK AVENUE DAY CARE CENTER","lat":38.90672269,"lon":-77.01316148,"first_year":2010,"last_year":2011,"cip_history":{"FY2010":{"FY2010":500,"FY2011":0,"FY2012":0,"FY2013":1500,"FY2014":0,"FY2015":0},"FY2011":{"FY2011":0,"FY2012":0,"FY2013":0,"FY2014":0,"FY2015":0,"FY2016":1500}},"cumulative_funding":{"funding_by_phase":{"(01) Design":{"FY2010":{"allotted":200,"spent":0,"proposed":500},"FY2011":{"allotted":721,"spent":0,"proposed":0}},"(03) Project Management":{"FY2011":{"allotted":21,"spent":0,"proposed":0}},"(04) Construction":{"FY2011":{"allotted":0,"spent":0,"proposed":0}}},"funding_by_source":{"GO Bonds - New (0300)":{"FY2010":{"allotted":200,"spent":0,"proposed":500},"FY2011":{"allotted":721,"spent":0,"proposed":0}}},"total_funding":{"FY2010":{"allotted":200,"spent":0,"proposed":500},"FY2011":{"allotted":721,"spent":0,"proposed":0}}},"est_cost":721000}
