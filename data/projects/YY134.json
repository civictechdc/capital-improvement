For some schools, Systems Component modernization may involve targeted small capital projects needed to update or replace components of a facility that is otherwise stabilized - increasing the school's electrical capacity to support computer labs or repairing or replacing a broken chiller that no longer adequately cools the gymnasium and auditorium, for example. In some cases, a facility may lack any air conditioning, and Systems Component modernization will rectify this issue.","justification":"The continuing modernization of schools supports the vision of the Mayor and Office of the Chancellor as identified in the DC Schools Master Facilities Plan. Modernization will ensure that the DC Public Schools provide a quality learning environment that will deliver classrooms supporting educational needs and provide safe, positive learning environments to District schoolchildren.","progress_assessment":"The project is progressing as planned.","related_projects":"All of OPEFMâ€™s projects in this Capital Improvement Program are part of a strategic approach to modernize the core components of every DCPS school in the next five years.","milestones":{"environmental_approvals":{},"design_start":{},"design_complete":{},"construction_start":{},"construction_complete":{},"closeout":{}},"useful_life":30,"lat":null,"lon":null,"first_year":2010,"last_year":2010,"cip_history":{"FY2010":{"plan":{"FY2010":0,"FY2011":0,"FY2012":0,"FY2013":0,"FY2014":46934,"FY2015":272007},"est_cost":null}},"cumulative_funding":{"funding_by_phase":{"(01) Design":{"FY2010":{"allotted":0,"spent":0,"proposed":0}},"(03) Project Management":{"FY2010":{"allotted":0,"spent":0,"proposed":0}},"(04) Construction":{"FY2010":{"allotted":0,"spent":0,"proposed":0}}},"funding_by_source":{"GO Bonds - New (0300)":{"FY2010":{"allotted":0,"spent":0,"proposed":0}},"Pay Go (0301)":{"FY2010":{"allotted":0,"spent":0,"proposed":0}}},"total_funding":{"FY2010":{"allotted":0,"spent":0,"proposed":0}}},"est_cost":0}
