It will be a full-service crime laboratory, medicalexaminer/morgue facility, and public health laboratory that meets all applicable national standards. The Consolidated Laboratory facility will improve the quality and efficiency of these services by consolidating the operations of the following agencies and divisions into one facility: District of Columbia Public Health Laboratory (DOH); Office of the Chief Medical Examiner (OCME); and Metropolitan Police Department (MPD) Forensic Laboratory. This consolidation will result in better coordination of services for public safety and a reduction on the current backlog of crime investigations. The scope of work for this project includes, but is not limited to the following: development of architectural and engineering scope of work; demolition of existing MPD First District (MPD 1-D); construction; facility commissioning; fit-up relocation; laboratory equipment including new Lab IT Solution (LIM); and occupancy of the facility.","justification":"All three agencies involved with the project are currently working inside aging facilities that do not meet todayâ€™s scientific standards. In addition, the District wants to expand its capabilities in supporting public safety/public health sectors by conducting new scientific investigations that are not being performed today. This project will help minimize the backlog of open criminal cases to serve justice. The project is a priority for the Mayor and Council.","progress_assessment":"The project is progressing as planned on schedule and is currently under construction.","related_projects":"former Bowen Elementary School renovation into new MPD 1-D headquarters; MPD Evidence Warehouse.
