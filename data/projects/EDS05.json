Construction will improve reliability and safety of transit services, including transit lanes, provide bicycle lanes and improve pedestrian circulation. Use of project funds is restricted to corridor revitalization in Retail Priority Areas, in accordance with the Fiscal Year 2014 Budget Support Act of 2013, as amended.","justification":"In 2008, the District made $95,000,000 in Tax Increment Financing (TIF) available to support economic development projects in Retail Priority Areas. Five years later, much of the funding had gone unused. Instead of continuing a  program that had been unsuccessful, debt service for the TIF program has been set aside for capital improvement projects in Retail Priority Areas.","progress_assessment":"-","related_projects":"ED311C-KENNEDY STREET STREETSCAPES, ED102C-RHODE ISLAND AVENUE NE SMALL AREA PLAN","milestones":{"environmental_approvals":{},"design_start":{},"design_complete":{},"construction_start":{},"construction_complete":{},"closeout":{}},"est_cost":43328000,"useful_life":30,"lat":null,"lon":null,"first_year":2014,"last_year":2014,"cip_history":{"FY2014":{"FY2014":4508,"FY2015":4636,"FY2016":5474,"FY2017":5474,"FY2018":5474,"FY2019":5474}},"cumulative_funding":{"funding_by_phase":{"(01) Design":{"FY2014":{"allotted":12288,"spent":11890,"proposed":4508}},"(03) Project Management":{"FY2014":{"allotted":1500,"spent":1500,"proposed":0}},"(04) Construction":{"FY2014":{"allotted":9999,"spent":9800,"proposed":4508}}},"funding_by_source":{"Pay Go (0301)":{"FY2014":{"allotted":0,"spent":0,"proposed":4508}},"LRMF - Bus Shelter Ad Revenue (0333)":{"FY2014":{"allotted":12288,"spent":12288,"proposed":0}}},"total_funding":{"FY2014":{"allotted":12288,"spent":11890,"proposed":4508}}}}
