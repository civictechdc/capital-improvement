When the Reeves Center is redeveloped, the TMC will need to be relocated.  This effort will enable DDOT and the District to implement a state-of-the-art-facility that uses advanced technology to monitor real-time traffic conditions.  This will enable DDOT to manage and influence the travel choices of residents, commuters and visitors by promoting efficient use of the existing transportation network throughout the District.  This is also an opportunity to co-locate other District agencies that need information about traffic information, such as FEMS and MPD.","justification":"Communications for and control of the District’s traffic signals (more than 1600) are managed from Traffic Management Center (TMC) at the Reeves Center.
