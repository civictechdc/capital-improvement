Funding is needed to characterize the sediments in the entire estuary area of the Anacostia and develop a cleanup remedy. The sediments are an on-going source of contaminants and need to be addressed before the Anacostia can be returned to a “fishable and swimmable” river. Testing needs to be conducted on Anacostia sediment and water toxins (when present) to determine proper clean-up methods and potentially isolate the source of contamination from the clean-up sites.","progress_assessment":"Ongoing.","related_projects":"Department of General Services project PL103C-HAZARDOUS MATERIAL ABATEMENT POOL","milestones":{"environmental_approvals":{"projected":"10/01/11"},"design_start":{"projected":"03/01/12"},"design_complete":{"projected":"05/31/12"},"construction_start":{"projected":"12/01/12"},"construction_complete":{"projected":"09/30/21"},"closeout":{"projected":"12/31/22"}},"est_cost":83396000,"useful_life":30,"lat":null,"lon":null,"first_year":2012,"last_year":2022,"cip_history":{"FY2012":{"FY2012":0,"FY2013":0,"FY2014":0,"FY2015":25000,"FY2016":25000,"FY2017":24000},"FY2013":{"FY2013":1500,"FY2014":3500,"FY2015":15000,"FY2016":15000,"FY2017":13500,"FY2018":0},"FY2014":{"FY2014":1500,"FY2015":15000,"FY2016":15000,"FY2017":10000,"FY2018":0,"FY2019":0},"FY2015":{"FY2015":6000,"FY2016":15000,"FY2017":10000,"FY2018":0,"FY2019":4500,"FY2020":9500},"FY2016":{"FY2016":10000,"FY2017":5000,"FY2018":5000,"FY2019":5000,"FY2020":9500,"FY2021":7613},"FY2017":{"FY2017":5000,"FY2018":5000,"FY2019":5000,"FY2020":9500,"FY2021":6000,"FY2022":33906}},"cumulative_funding":{"funding_by_phase":{"(04) Construction":{"FY2012":{"allotted":0,"spent":0,"proposed":0},"FY2013":{"allotted":0,"spent":0,"proposed":1500},"FY2014":{"allotted":1015,"spent":888,"proposed":1500},"FY2015":{"allotted":2990,"spent":2019,"proposed":6000},"FY2016":{"allotted":8990,"spent":8990,"proposed":10000},"FY2017":{"allotted":18990,"spent":18990,"proposed":5000},"FY2018":{"allotted":23990,"spent":18990,"proposed":5000},"FY2019":{"allotted":28990,"spent":18990,"proposed":5000},"FY2020":{"allotted":33990,"spent":18990,"proposed":9500},"FY2021":{"allotted":43490,"spent":18990,"proposed":6000},"FY2022":{"allotted":49490,"spent":18990,"proposed":33906}}},"funding_by_source":{"GO Bonds - New (0300)":{"FY2012":{"allotted":0,"spent":0,"proposed":0},"FY2013":{"allotted":0,"spent":0,"proposed":1500},"FY2014":{"allotted":1015,"spent":888,"proposed":1500},"FY2015":{"allotted":2515,"spent":2019,"proposed":6000},"FY2016":{"allotted":8515,"spent":8515,"proposed":10000},"FY2017":{"allotted":18515,"spent":18515,"proposed":5000},"FY2018":{"allotted":23515,"spent":18515,"proposed":5000},"FY2019":{"allotted":28515,"spent":18515,"proposed":5000},"FY2020":{"allotted":33515,"spent":18515,"proposed":0},"FY2021":{"allotted":33515,"spent":18515,"proposed":6000},"FY2022":{"allotted":39515,"spent":18515,"proposed":5974}},"Pay Go (0301)":{"FY2012":{"allotted":0,"spent":0,"proposed":0},"FY2013":{"allotted":0,"spent":0,"proposed":0},"FY2015":{"allotted":475,"spent":0,"proposed":0},"FY2016":{"allotted":475,"spent":475,"proposed":0},"FY2017":{"allotted":475,"spent":475,"proposed":0},"FY2018":{"allotted":475,"spent":475,"proposed":0},"FY2019":{"allotted":475,"spent":475,"proposed":0},"FY2020":{"allotted":475,"spent":475,"proposed":9500},"FY2021":{"allotted":9975,"spent":475,"proposed":0},"FY2022":{"allotted":9975,"spent":475,"proposed":27932}}},"total_funding":{"FY2012":{"allotted":0,"spent":0,"proposed":0},"FY2013":{"allotted":0,"spent":0,"proposed":1500},"FY2014":{"allotted":1015,"spent":888,"proposed":1500},"FY2015":{"allotted":2990,"spent":2019,"proposed":6000},"FY2016":{"allotted":8990,"spent":8990,"proposed":10000},"FY2017":{"allotted":18990,"spent":18990,"proposed":5000},"FY2018":{"allotted":23990,"spent":18990,"proposed":5000},"FY2019":{"allotted":28990,"spent":18990,"proposed":5000},"FY2020":{"allotted":33990,"spent":18990,"proposed":9500},"FY2021":{"allotted":43490,"spent":18990,"proposed":6000},"FY2022":{"allotted":49490,"spent":18990,"proposed":33906}}}}
