These centers would provide PS and PK classrooms, as well as an opportunity to coordinate with other DCPS programs including Early Stages, and community-based providers serving infants and toddlers and their parents.","justification":"The proposed early learning centers would allow the Office of Early Childhood Education to create model centers to facilitate peer-to-peer learning and professional development across DCPS early childhood programs using the Tools of the Mind curriculum.  Each ELC would be designed to serve children, from birth to age five, in collaboration with a community child care partner.","progress_assessment":"This is a new project.","related_projects":"-","milestones":{"environmental_approvals":{},"design_start":{},"design_complete":{},"construction_start":{},"construction_complete":{},"closeout":{}},"est_cost":1800000,"useful_life":30,"lat":null,"lon":null,"first_year":2014,"last_year":2014,"cip_history":{"FY2014":{"plan":{"FY2014":1800,"FY2015":0,"FY2016":0,"FY2017":0,"FY2018":0,"FY2019":0},"est_cost":1800000}},"cumulative_funding":{"funding_by_phase":{"(04) Construction":{"FY2014":{"allotted":0,"spent":0,"proposed":1800}}},"funding_by_source":{"GO Bonds - New (0300)":{"FY2014":{"allotted":0,"spent":0,"proposed":1800}}},"total_funding":{"FY2014":{"allotted":0,"spent":0,"proposed":1800}}}}
