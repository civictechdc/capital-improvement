The existing building is undersized to meet the school’s existing needs and it is envisioned that new space will need to be added as an “in-fill” addition in order to fully meet programmatic requirements, creating a total property of approx. 279,524 SF. The renovated facility will serve approx. 600 students and will serve as a regional magnet school for the performing arts. DGS is seeking design excellence capable of transforming the school building into an icon for the performing arts while respecting the historic character of the existing building.  The project is to be completed prior to the beginning of the 2017/2018 school year.","justification":"This project was included in the Master Facilities Plan adopted by Section 4111 of the Fiscal Year 2011 Budget Support Act of 2010.
