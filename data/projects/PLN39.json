Agency teams would compete against each other for the funds based on the results they can achieve and they would be encouraged to leverage formula funds (e.g., CDBG) and federal funding received, especially when the project would expand the impact of a project limited by the scope of those funding sources.  Extra points would be given to agencies that propose community partnerships as part of the project implementation.  Short and long term performance metrics would be required of applicants.","justification":"This initiative will challenge two or more agencies to form a partnership to develop and implement projects that support priorities from the Mayor's Ward 8 Citizen's Summit.
