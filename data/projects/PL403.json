{"active":false,"project_no":"PL403","title":"UNDERGROUND COMMERCIAL POWER FEED TO UCC","agency":"OFFICE OF UNIFIED COMMUNICATIONS (UC0)","implementing_agency":"DEPARTMENT OF GENERAL SERVICES (AM0)","ward":"","location":"2720 MARTIN LUTHER KING, JR. AVE. SE","facility":"UNIFIED COMMUNICATIONS CENTER","status":"New","description":"This project adds an underground commercial power feed from a grid other than the one currently servicing the Unified Communications Center (UCC). It will reduce the facility’s exposure to disrupted commercial power. The facility houses the Office of Unified Communications’ emergency and non-emergency call centers, the Homeland Security and Emergency Management Agency’s Emergency Operations Center (EOC), and serves as the Mayor’s Disaster Hub in incidents of natural and man-made disasters.","justification":"In the construction of UCC, an underground power source was eliminated because it was deemed too cost-prohibitive.  However, the recent earthquake, hurricanes, and numerous power outages have exemplified not only why the UCC should be serviced by an underground commercial power source, but also why that source should come from an alternative grid.  The UCC houses many critical emergency components during crucial time periods; it is imperative that the facility protect itself against acts of terrorism, natural disasters, and accidental events.","progress_assessment":"This is a new project.","related_projects":"N/A","milestones":{"environmental_approvals":{},"design_start":{},"design_complete":{},"construction_start":{},"construction_complete":{},"closeout":{}},"est_cost":7000000,"useful_life":15,"lat":38.8537276,"lon":-76.99504482,"first_year":2014,"last_year":2015,"cip_history":{"FY2014":{"plan":{"FY2014":6000,"FY2015":1000,"FY2016":0,"FY2017":0,"FY2018":0,"FY2019":0},"est_cost":7000000},"FY2015":{"plan":{"FY2015":1000,"FY2016":0,"FY2017":0,"FY2018":0,"FY2019":0,"FY2020":0},"est_cost":7000000}},"cumulative_funding":{"funding_by_phase":{"(04) Construction":{"FY2014":{"allotted":0,"spent":0,"proposed":6000},"FY2015":{"allotted":5700,"spent":0,"proposed":884}},"(01) Design":{"FY2015":{"allotted":300,"spent":269,"proposed":116}}},"funding_by_source":{"GO Bonds - New (0300)":{"FY2014":{"allotted":0,"spent":0,"proposed":6000},"FY2015":{"allotted":6000,"spent":269,"proposed":1000}}},"total_funding":{"FY2014":{"allotted":0,"spent":0,"proposed":6000},"FY2015":{"allotted":6000,"spent":269,"proposed":1000}}}}
