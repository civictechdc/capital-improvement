Shared classroom space for classes such as art and music require the same attention as regular classrooms, particularly in high schools where non-core classes and extracurricular programs are a key component of a well-rounded academic program. Other school space such as auditoriums, gymnasiums and locker rooms currently reflect some of the most serious neglect in our schools. These spaces must be renovated to support a full range of extra-curricular offerings that help create a well-rounded educational environment. Modernization of these Support Component features in school buildings is important to the overall educational environment and must be addressed with the same strategic approach, focusing on those most in need in order to support the academic program and to complement modernization work for core Academic Components.","justification":"The continuing modernization of schools supports the vision of the Mayor and Office of the Chancellor as identified in the DC Schools Master Facilities Plan. Modernization will ensure that the DC Public Schools provide a quality learning environment that will deliver classrooms supporting educational needs and provide safe, positive learning environments to District schoolchildren.","progress_assessment":"The project is progressing as planned.","related_projects":"All of OPEFMâ€™s projects in this Capital Improvement Program are part of a strategic approach to modernize the core components of every DCPS school in the next five years.","milestones":{"environmental_approvals":{},"design_start":{},"design_complete":{},"construction_start":{},"construction_complete":{},"closeout":{}},"useful_life":30,"facility":"N/A","lat":null,"lon":null,"first_year":2010,"last_year":2011,"cip_history":{"FY2010":{"FY2010":35098,"FY2011":20238,"FY2012":39602,"FY2013":75460,"FY2014":92613,"FY2015":0},"FY2011":{"FY2011":29216,"FY2012":38973,"FY2013":48009,"FY2014":30564,"FY2015":46683,"FY2016":56841}},"cumulative_funding":{"funding_by_phase":{"(01) Design":{"FY2010":{"allotted":0,"spent":0,"proposed":35098}},"(03) Project Management":{"FY2010":{"allotted":0,"spent":0,"proposed":2338},"FY2011":{"allotted":22202,"spent":1774,"proposed":29216}},"(04) Construction":{"FY2010":{"allotted":0,"spent":0,"proposed":32760},"FY2011":{"allotted":20442,"spent":46,"proposed":27114}},"(05) Equipment":{"FY2010":{"allotted":0,"spent":0,"proposed":0}}},"funding_by_source":{"GO Bonds - New (0300)":{"FY2010":{"allotted":0,"spent":0,"proposed":35098},"FY2011":{"allotted":22201,"spent":1773,"proposed":29217}},"Pay Go (0301)":{"FY2010":{"allotted":0,"spent":0,"proposed":0},"FY2011":{"allotted":0,"spent":0,"proposed":0}}},"total_funding":{"FY2010":{"allotted":0,"spent":0,"proposed":35098},"FY2011":{"allotted":22202,"spent":1774,"proposed":29216}}},"est_cost":51418000}
