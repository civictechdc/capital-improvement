{"active":true,"project_no":"BF301","title":"SOAR MODERNIZATION","image":"fy10-53_1.jpg","agency":"OFFICE OF THE CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER (AT0)","implementing_agency":"OFFICE OF THE CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER (AT0)","ward":"","location":"DISTRICT-WIDE","status":"Ongoing Subprojects","description":"This project will implement major enhancements and improvements to the District’s General Ledger System by replacing and modernizing key components of the current R-STARS system with a modern web-based system utilizing industry best practices.","justification":"The project will achieve a full system upgrade of all major components of the District’s General Ledger system.  The current District General Ledger system is based on 20 year old technology.  Supporting this technology is becoming ever more complicated since the resources and skill-sets needed to support a mainframe based system are not easily available.  Moreover, the current General Ledger system lacks functionality found in modern systems necessary to support real-time financial management and allow the OCFO to provide greater integration with other key District systems such as the cash management system, budgeting systems, Human Resources and Payroll systems, and the tax systems.","progress_assessment":"The project budget was first allotted in FY 2007, and all requirements assessment activities have been completed. The CFO is fully committed to a successful effort as part of his strategic plan.  However, given the magnitude of the effort it will require, and the resources needed to successfully implement the Modernization of the Integrated Tax System (MITS), we must focus our efforts on initiating one major IT initiative at a time.  Given the return on our investment, the MITS project is being initiated first.  The SOAR and BFA replacement project will begin about 18 months from now – or about September 2016.","related_projects":"All core financial systems in the District are tightly integrated and interrelated.  The OCFO is in the process of modernizing and implementing all core financial systems to bring these systems in line with current industry trends and District stakeholder needs","milestones":{"environmental_approvals":{},"design_start":{},"design_complete":{"projected":"03/30/11"},"construction_start":{"projected":"09/30/11"},"construction_complete":{"projected":"10/01/20"},"closeout":{"projected":"09/30/22"}},"useful_life":10,"facility":"INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY","est_cost":82105000,"lat":null,"lon":null,"first_year":2010,"last_year":2022,"cip_history":{"FY2010":{"FY2010":2000,"FY2011":3000,"FY2012":0,"FY2013":0,"FY2014":0,"FY2015":0},"FY2011":{"FY2011":3000,"FY2012":3000,"FY2013":0,"FY2014":0,"FY2015":0,"FY2016":0},"FY2013":{"FY2013":2680,"FY2014":0,"FY2015":0,"FY2016":0,"FY2017":0,"FY2018":0},"FY2015":{"FY2015":10000,"FY2016":0,"FY2017":0,"FY2018":7000,"FY2019":18500,"FY2020":18500},"FY2016":{"FY2016":0,"FY2017":0,"FY2018":6000,"FY2019":10000,"FY2020":18500,"FY2021":10000},"FY2017":{"FY2017":0,"FY2018":0,"FY2019":0,"FY2020":0,"FY2021":0,"FY2022":5500}},"cumulative_funding":{"funding_by_phase":{"(05) Equipment":{"FY2010":{"allotted":5000,"spent":636,"proposed":2000},"FY2011":{"allotted":9836,"spent":1384,"proposed":3000},"FY2013":{"allotted":22376,"spent":20344,"proposed":2680},"FY2015":{"allotted":26056,"spent":16786,"proposed":10000},"FY2016":{"allotted":37605,"spent":15783,"proposed":0},"FY2017":{"allotted":31605,"spent":15783,"proposed":0},"FY2018":{"allotted":31605,"spent":15783,"proposed":0},"FY2019":{"allotted":31605,"spent":15783,"proposed":0},"FY2020":{"allotted":31605,"spent":15783,"proposed":0},"FY2021":{"allotted":31605,"spent":15783,"proposed":0},"FY2022":{"allotted":31605,"spent":15783,"proposed":5500}}},"funding_by_source":{"GO Bonds - New (0300)":{"FY2010":{"allotted":5000,"spent":636,"proposed":2000},"FY2011":{"allotted":9836,"spent":1384,"proposed":3000},"FY2013":{"allotted":21889,"spent":19865,"proposed":2680},"FY2015":{"allotted":25569,"spent":16307,"proposed":10000},"FY2016":{"allotted":37126,"spent":15304,"proposed":0},"FY2017":{"allotted":31126,"spent":15304,"proposed":0},"FY2018":{"allotted":31126,"spent":15304,"proposed":0},"FY2019":{"allotted":31126,"spent":15304,"proposed":0},"FY2020":{"allotted":31126,"spent":15304,"proposed":0},"FY2021":{"allotted":31126,"spent":15304,"proposed":0},"FY2022":{"allotted":31126,"spent":15304,"proposed":5500}},"Pay Go (0301)":{"FY2013":{"allotted":487,"spent":480,"proposed":0},"FY2015":{"allotted":487,"spent":480,"proposed":0},"FY2016":{"allotted":480,"spent":480,"proposed":0},"FY2017":{"allotted":480,"spent":480,"proposed":0},"FY2018":{"allotted":480,"spent":480,"proposed":0},"FY2019":{"allotted":480,"spent":480,"proposed":0},"FY2020":{"allotted":480,"spent":480,"proposed":0},"FY2021":{"allotted":480,"spent":480,"proposed":0},"FY2022":{"allotted":480,"spent":480,"proposed":0}}},"total_funding":{"FY2010":{"allotted":5000,"spent":636,"proposed":2000},"FY2011":{"allotted":9836,"spent":1384,"proposed":3000},"FY2013":{"allotted":22376,"spent":20344,"proposed":2680},"FY2015":{"allotted":26056,"spent":16786,"proposed":10000},"FY2016":{"allotted":37605,"spent":15783,"proposed":0},"FY2017":{"allotted":31605,"spent":15783,"proposed":0},"FY2018":{"allotted":31605,"spent":15783,"proposed":0},"FY2019":{"allotted":31605,"spent":15783,"proposed":0},"FY2020":{"allotted":31605,"spent":15783,"proposed":0},"FY2021":{"allotted":31605,"spent":15783,"proposed":0},"FY2022":{"allotted":31605,"spent":15783,"proposed":5500}}}}
