This project will enable the Department to secure major durable equipment items that have long lead times between the placement of the order and the delivery of the item. Further, the project is expected to have a beneficial impact on the operating budget by eliminating the need for expedited processing of long lead time equipment orders, which disrupt regular work flow, and the efficiency of the procurement process.
