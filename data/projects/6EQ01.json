This equipment includes vehicles for the snow removal program, single and multi-space parking meters, passenger vehicles, and other equipment for the maintenance of roads and bridges and the care of trees. The purchase of snow equipment will help ensure that DDOT can meet the Mayor's standards for snow removal. Parking meters, especially multi-space meters, help ensure that parking fees are collected. The project can help reduce operating costs when older fleet vehicles are replaced with newer ones that are more fuel efficient and require less maintenance.","justification":"This project is necessary to provide for vehicles that remove snow from streets, to replace broken parking meters, and to provide replacement vehicles.The DDOT fleet replacement plan helps ensure that vehicles are operational and to reduce maintenance costs (including fuel) as much as possible.","progress_assessment":"The project is progressing as planned.  Snow equipment and vehicles, parking meters, and other equipment are purchases according to replacement plans.","related_projects":"6EQ02C-MAJOR EQUIPMENT ACQUISITION, CE302C-EQUIPMENT MAINTENANCE","milestones":{"environmental_approvals":{},"design_start":{},"design_complete":{},"construction_start":{},"construction_complete":{},"closeout":{}},"useful_life":5,"ward":"","est_cost":21240000,"facility":"EQUIPMENT","lat":null,"lon":null,"first_year":2011,"last_year":2022,"cip_history":{"FY2011":{"FY2011":1000,"FY2012":1000,"FY2013":1000,"FY2014":1000,"FY2015":1000,"FY2016":1000},"FY2012":{"FY2012":1000,"FY2013":1000,"FY2014":950,"FY2015":910,"FY2016":910,"FY2017":800},"FY2013":{"FY2013":1000,"FY2014":950,"FY2015":910,"FY2016":910,"FY2017":800,"FY2018":0},"FY2014":{"FY2014":500,"FY2015":501,"FY2016":2410,"FY2017":1200,"FY2018":1000,"FY2019":1200},"FY2015":{"FY2015":501,"FY2016":2410,"FY2017":1200,"FY2018":1000,"FY2019":1200,"FY2020":1200},"FY2016":{"FY2016":1500,"FY2017":1000,"FY2018":1000,"FY2019":1200,"FY2020":1200,"FY2021":1500},"FY2017":{"FY2017":1750,"FY2018":1500,"FY2019":1350,"FY2020":1200,"FY2021":1500,"FY2022":2400}},"cumulative_funding":{"funding_by_phase":{"(05) Equipment":{"FY2011":{"allotted":5540,"spent":5222,"proposed":1000},"FY2012":{"allotted":7039,"spent":6803,"proposed":1000},"FY2013":{"allotted":8039,"spent":7863,"proposed":1000},"FY2014":{"allotted":9039,"spent":8419,"proposed":500},"FY2015":{"allotted":9539,"spent":9452,"proposed":501},"FY2016":{"allotted":10040,"spent":9200,"proposed":1500},"FY2017":{"allotted":11540,"spent":11385,"proposed":1750},"FY2018":{"allotted":13290,"spent":11385,"proposed":1500},"FY2019":{"allotted":14790,"spent":11385,"proposed":1350},"FY2020":{"allotted":16140,"spent":11385,"proposed":1200},"FY2021":{"allotted":17340,"spent":11385,"proposed":1500},"FY2022":{"allotted":18840,"spent":11385,"proposed":2400}}},"funding_by_source":{"Local Street Main (0330)":{"FY2011":{"allotted":3540,"spent":3457,"proposed":0}},"Local Sts - PAYGO (0331)":{"FY2011":{"allotted":1000,"spent":1000,"proposed":0},"FY2012":{"allotted":1000,"spent":1000,"proposed":0},"FY2013":{"allotted":1000,"spent":1000,"proposed":0},"FY2014":{"allotted":1000,"spent":1000,"proposed":0},"FY2015":{"allotted":1000,"spent":1000,"proposed":0},"FY2016":{"allotted":1000,"spent":1000,"proposed":0},"FY2017":{"allotted":1000,"spent":1000,"proposed":0},"FY2018":{"allotted":1000,"spent":1000,"proposed":0},"FY2019":{"allotted":1000,"spent":1000,"proposed":0},"FY2020":{"allotted":1000,"spent":1000,"proposed":0},"FY2021":{"allotted":1000,"spent":1000,"proposed":0},"FY2022":{"allotted":1000,"spent":1000,"proposed":0}},"Local Sts - Parking Tax (0332)":{"FY2011":{"allotted":1000,"spent":599,"proposed":1000},"FY2012":{"allotted":2499,"spent":2263,"proposed":0},"FY2013":{"allotted":2499,"spent":2499,"proposed":0},"FY2014":{"allotted":2499,"spent":2499,"proposed":0},"FY2015":{"allotted":2499,"spent":2494,"proposed":0},"FY2016":{"allotted":2499,"spent":2494,"proposed":0}},"Local Transportation Revenue (0330)":{"FY2012":{"allotted":3540,"spent":3540,"proposed":1000},"FY2013":{"allotted":4540,"spent":4364,"proposed":1000},"FY2014":{"allotted":5540,"spent":4920,"proposed":500},"FY2015":{"allotted":6040,"spent":5958,"proposed":501},"FY2016":{"allotted":6541,"spent":5706,"proposed":1500}},"Local Trans.
