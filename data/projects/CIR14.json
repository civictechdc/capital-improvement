A large number of Georgetown University employees live in Shaw.  The Union Station/Georgetown line extension to the National Cathedral is on DDOT's priority list.  It would make one of the District’s most popular tourist attractions more accessible. It would also provide additional bus service along a dense residential and commercial corridor that is not served by Metrorail. Extending the Union Station / Navy Yard route one mile to the Southwest Waterfront Metro station would connect two rapidly developing neighborhoods and link the Waterfront with Metrorail’s Red Line.","progress_assessment":"Ongoing project.","related_projects":"CIRFLC-Circulator Fleet Rehab; CIRBG-DBOM Circulator Bus Garage","milestones":{"environmental_approvals":{},"design_start":{},"design_complete":{},"construction_start":{},"construction_complete":{},"closeout":{}},"est_cost":61257000,"lat":null,"lon":null,"first_year":2014,"last_year":2022,"cip_history":{"FY2014":{"plan":{"FY2014":4725,"FY2015":0,"FY2016":0,"FY2017":0,"FY2018":0,"FY2019":0},"est_cost":4725000},"FY2015":{"plan":{"FY2015":7702,"FY2016":17012,"FY2017":17600,"FY2018":0,"FY2019":7100,"FY2020":0},"est_cost":56640000},"FY2016":{"plan":{"FY2016":17012,"FY2017":12600,"FY2018":0,"FY2019":0,"FY2020":0,"FY2021":0},"est_cost":46857000},"FY2017":{"plan":{"FY2017":10000,"FY2018":0,"FY2019":0,"FY2020":0,"FY2021":0,"FY2022":17000},"est_cost":61257000}},"cumulative_funding":{"funding_by_phase":{"(01) Design":{"FY2014":{"allotted":0,"spent":0,"proposed":4725},"FY2015":{"allotted":7225,"spent":0,"proposed":7702},"FY2016":{"allotted":17245,"spent":7482,"proposed":14422},"FY2017":{"allotted":31667,"spent":7886,"proposed":10000},"FY2018":{"allotted":41667,"spent":7886,"proposed":0},"FY2019":{"allotted":41667,"spent":7886,"proposed":0},"FY2020":{"allotted":41667,"spent":7886,"proposed":0},"FY2021":{"allotted":41667,"spent":7886,"proposed":0},"FY2022":{"allotted":41667,"spent":7886,"proposed":17000}},"(04) Construction":{"FY2015":{"allotted":0,"spent":0,"proposed":0},"FY2016":{"allotted":0,"spent":0,"proposed":2590},"FY2017":{"allotted":2590,"spent":0,"proposed":0},"FY2018":{"allotted":2590,"spent":0,"proposed":0},"FY2019":{"allotted":2590,"spent":0,"proposed":0},"FY2020":{"allotted":2590,"spent":0,"proposed":0},"FY2021":{"allotted":2590,"spent":0,"proposed":0},"FY2022":{"allotted":2590,"spent":0,"proposed":0}}},"funding_by_source":{"GO Bonds - New (0300)":{"FY2014":{"allotted":0,"spent":0,"proposed":4725},"FY2015":{"allotted":4725,"spent":0,"proposed":7702},"FY2016":{"allotted":14745,"spent":4982,"proposed":14422},"FY2017":{"allotted":29167,"spent":5386,"proposed":10000},"FY2018":{"allotted":39167,"spent":5386,"proposed":0},"FY2019":{"allotted":39167,"spent":5386,"proposed":0},"FY2020":{"allotted":39167,"spent":5386,"proposed":0},"FY2021":{"allotted":39167,"spent":5386,"proposed":0},"FY2022":{"allotted":39167,"spent":5386,"proposed":17000}},"Pay Go (0301)":{"FY2015":{"allotted":0,"spent":0,"proposed":0},"FY2016":{"allotted":0,"spent":0,"proposed":2590},"FY2017":{"allotted":2590,"spent":0,"proposed":0},"FY2018":{"allotted":2590,"spent":0,"proposed":0},"FY2019":{"allotted":2590,"spent":0,"proposed":0},"FY2020":{"allotted":2590,"spent":0,"proposed":0},"FY2021":{"allotted":2590,"spent":0,"proposed":0},"FY2022":{"allotted":2590,"spent":0,"proposed":0}},"Local Transportation Revenue (0330)":{"FY2015":{"allotted":2500,"spent":0,"proposed":0},"FY2016":{"allotted":2500,"spent":2500,"proposed":0}},"Local Trans.
