This new system would be integrated with DHCF’s claims processing system (MMIS), and it would identify likely fraud, waste, and abuse prior to paying the claim.  Moving fraud, waste, and abuse detection earlier in the claims adjudication and payment process will allow DHCF to prevent payment of inappropriate claims and minimize the current practice of “pay-and-chase” for these claims.","justification":"As the Medicaid program continues to expand coverage and benefits, the department needs additional tools to protect the program from fraud, waste and abuse.  This new system would allow DHCF to prevent payment of inappropriate claims and minimize the current practice of “pay-and-chase” for these claims.","progress_assessment":"New Project","related_projects":"MPM03C-MMIS Upgraded System","milestones":{"environmental_approvals":{},"design_start":{},"design_complete":{},"construction_start":{},"construction_complete":{},"closeout":{}},"est_cost":475000,"useful_life":5,"lat":null,"lon":null,"first_year":2015,"last_year":2016,"cip_history":{"FY2015":{"plan":{"FY2015":125,"FY2016":475,"FY2017":0,"FY2018":0,"FY2019":0,"FY2020":0},"est_cost":600000},"FY2016":{"plan":{"FY2016":475,"FY2017":0,"FY2018":0,"FY2019":0,"FY2020":0,"FY2021":0},"est_cost":475000}},"cumulative_funding":{"funding_by_phase":{"(01) Design":{"FY2015":{"allotted":0,"spent":0,"proposed":125},"FY2016":{"allotted":0,"spent":0,"proposed":475}}},"funding_by_source":{"GO Bonds - New (0300)":{"FY2015":{"allotted":0,"spent":0,"proposed":125},"FY2016":{"allotted":0,"spent":0,"proposed":475}}},"total_funding":{"FY2015":{"allotted":0,"spent":0,"proposed":125},"FY2016":{"allotted":0,"spent":0,"proposed":475}}}}
