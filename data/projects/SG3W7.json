The modernization may include classroom renovations and core spaces; upgraded mechanical systems; new windows; restoration of the building exterior; new roofing; other interior improvements; new fixtures, furniture, and equipment; site improvements; and technology infrastructure upgrades.","justification":"DCPS operates six competitive application middle/high schools:  Benjamin Banneker HS, Columbia Heights Education Center, Ellington School of the Arts, Phelps Architecture, Construction, and Engineering HS, School Without Walls SHS, and McKinley Technology HS.  These applicationschools are located in Wards 1, 2, and 5.  Students living in other wards must travel to these wards to avail themselves of the best academic opportunities offered in the city.  Half of the DCPS application schools enroll at least one third of their students from Wards 7 and 8.  If we want to encourage and promote development of high achieving Wards 7 and 8 students, we need to provide them with educational opportunities in their own communities that will challenge them and reward their hard work.","progress_assessment":"To support planning and modernization of application middle school space east of the Anacostia River.","related_projects":"GM312C-ES/MS Modernization Capital Labor-Program","milestones":{"environmental_approvals":{"projected":"04/25/16"},"design_start":{"projected":"01/06/16"},"design_complete":{"projected":"06/06/16"},"construction_start":{"projected":"03//16"},"construction_complete":{"projected":"07/15/17"},"closeout":{"projected":"01/11/18"}},"est_cost":72675000,"useful_life":30,"lat":38.90656271,"lon":-76.93270478,"first_year":2015,"last_year":2017,"cip_history":{"FY2015":{"FY2015":8000,"FY2016":0,"FY2017":0,"FY2018":0,"FY2019":0,"FY2020":0},"FY2016":{"FY2016":29654,"FY2017":14943,"FY2018":0,"FY2019":0,"FY2020":0,"FY2021":0},"FY2017":{"FY2017":40443,"FY2018":0,"FY2019":0,"FY2020":0,"FY2021":0,"FY2022":0}},"cumulative_funding":{"funding_by_phase":{"(04) Construction":{"FY2015":{"allotted":0,"spent":0,"proposed":8000},"FY2016":{"allotted":2750,"spent":0,"proposed":29654},"FY2017":{"allotted":32232,"spent":27050,"proposed":40443}}},"funding_by_source":{"GO Bonds - New (0300)":{"FY2015":{"allotted":0,"spent":0,"proposed":8000},"FY2016":{"allotted":2750,"spent":0,"proposed":29654},"FY2017":{"allotted":28889,"spent":27050,"proposed":40443}},"Pay Go (0301)":{"FY2017":{"allotted":3343,"spent":0,"proposed":0}}},"total_funding":{"FY2015":{"allotted":0,"spent":0,"proposed":8000},"FY2016":{"allotted":2750,"spent":0,"proposed":29654},"FY2017":{"allotted":32232,"spent":27050,"proposed":40443}}}}
