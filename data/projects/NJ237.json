Many facility components(e.g. roofs, boilers, windows, etc.) at MacFarland ES Modernization/Renovation are in failure, or near failure modes. Operations and maintenance activities are unable to correct these problems due to cost. As these deficiencies continue, costs increase, not just in facility dollars, but more importantly on the impact of ability of the school to deliver quality curriculum in the classrooms. This revitalization will be accomplished through a revitalization/modernization or new building at MacFarland MS Modernization/Renovation and also bring the structure in compliance with the Americans with Disabilities Act(ADA). Further, this project will also eliminate the many facility emergencies that occur as the result of years of maintenance neglect in the past.","justification":"This project was included in the Master Facilities Plan adopted by Section 4111 of the Fiscal Year 2011 Budget Support Act of 2010.","progress_assessment":"-","related_projects":"See MFP.","milestones":{"environmental_approvals":{},"design_start":{"projected":"01/15/13"},"design_complete":{"projected":"04/01/14"},"construction_start":{"projected":"06/15/13"},"construction_complete":{"projected":"08/15/19"},"closeout":{}},"est_cost":30700000,"useful_life":30,"lat":38.94360856,"lon":-77.02777641,"first_year":2012,"last_year":2013,"cip_history":{"FY2012":{"plan":{"FY2012":0,"FY2013":7400,"FY2014":0,"FY2015":0,"FY2016":0,"FY2017":11900},"est_cost":30700000},"FY2013":{"plan":{"FY2013":0,"FY2014":0,"FY2015":0,"FY2016":0,"FY2017":0,"FY2018":7097},"est_cost":30700000}},"cumulative_funding":{"funding_by_phase":{"(04) Construction":{"FY2012":{"allotted":69,"spent":69,"proposed":0},"FY2013":{"allotted":0,"spent":0,"proposed":0}}},"funding_by_source":{"GO Bonds - New (0300)":{"FY2012":{"allotted":69,"spent":69,"proposed":0},"FY2013":{"allotted":0,"spent":0,"proposed":0}},"Pay Go (0301)":{"FY2013":{"allotted":0,"spent":0,"proposed":0}}},"total_funding":{"FY2012":{"allotted":69,"spent":69,"proposed":0},"FY2013":{"allotted":0,"spent":0,"proposed":0}}}}
