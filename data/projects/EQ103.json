{"active":false,"project_no":"EQ103","title":"CREDENTIALING AND WIRELESS-GO BOND","agency":"OFFICE OF CHIEF TECHNOLOGY OFFICER (TO0)","implementing_agency":"OFFICE OF CHIEF TECHNOLOGY OFFICER (TO0)","ward":"","location":"DISTRICT WIDE","facility":"INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY","status":"Ongoing Subprojects","description":"This project includes design and construction of wireless infrastructure in various forms, from broadband wireless connectivity to wireless credentialing infrastructure for city workers and residents.  Wireless credentialing focuses on the DC One Card initiative.  The DC One Card is a consolidated credential designed to give District government workers and residents access to District government facilities, programs, and resources.  The central platform for the DC One Card is a card that contains one or more wireless devices (chips).","justification":"This project is necessary because by consolidating credentials citywide, the District will be able to reduce the resources it uses for card production and management, thus saving money government-wide.  It also will provide substantial convenience to residents and easier access to government services.  The DC One Card will help the District contain costs of various government program resources that will be accessed via the card.","progress_assessment":"This project is progressing as planned.","related_projects":"EQ101C - CREDENTIALING AND WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS, PL401C-CITY-WIDE PHYSICAL ACCESS CONTROL SYSTEM.  Also, though not necessarily connected to this project, any project that relies on or could benefit from use of a card (usually for ease of counting service usage) can be related to the DC One Card initiative.","milestones":{"environmental_approvals":{},"design_start":{},"design_complete":{},"construction_start":{},"construction_complete":{},"closeout":{}},"est_cost":500000,"useful_life":5,"lat":null,"lon":null,"first_year":2014,"last_year":2014,"cip_history":{"FY2014":{"plan":{"FY2014":500,"FY2015":0,"FY2016":0,"FY2017":0,"FY2018":0,"FY2019":0},"est_cost":500000}},"cumulative_funding":{"funding_by_phase":{"(08) IT Deployment & Turnover":{"FY2014":{"allotted":0,"spent":0,"proposed":500}}},"funding_by_source":{"GO Bonds - New (0300)":{"FY2014":{"allotted":0,"spent":0,"proposed":500}}},"total_funding":{"FY2014":{"allotted":0,"spent":0,"proposed":500}}}}
