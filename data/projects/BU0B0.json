{"active":true,"project_no":"BU0B0","title":"VEHICLE  REPLACEMENT","agency":"SPECIAL EDUCATION TRANSPORTATION (GO0)","implementing_agency":"SPECIAL EDUCATION TRANSPORTATION (GO0)","ward":"","location":"DISTRICT-WIDE","facility":"BUSES","status":"Ongoing Subprojects","description":"The Office of the State Superintendent of Education (OSSE)’s Division of Transportation (DOT) current fleet of buses ranges in age from 3-15 years old. DOT seeks to sustain a replacement schedule of 8-year useful life for its bus fleet. Under this plan, DOT would replace 100 vehicles per year in 5 tranches spaced evenly throughout the year.  This plan would allow DOT to replace each of their 800 vehicles every 8 years.","justification":"The useful life of a school bus is typically 8 years.  Of OSSE DOT’s current fleet of approximately 800 buses, 308 are over 8 years and some are as old as 15 years.  186 have over 100,000 miles of use.  These older buses also affect over-time payments to drivers and attendants and on-time statistics due to increased breakdowns on the road. The current cost to maintain these older vehicles is more than $7.2M annually. This project aligns with SustainableDC Action: Transportation 4.2.","progress_assessment":"Ongoing subproject","related_projects":"BU0B2C-Special Ed.
