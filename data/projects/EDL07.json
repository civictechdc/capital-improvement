{"active":false,"project_no":"EDL07","title":"HOWARD THEATER STREETSCAPE IMPROVEMENTS","image":"fy12-260_1.png","agency":"DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION (KA0)","implementing_agency":"DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION (KA0)","ward":"1","location":"620 T STREET NW","status":"Ongoing Subprojects","description":"This project will improve the streetscape of the Howard Theater area, including roadways, alleys, curbs, gutters, sidewalks, tree boxes, and other infrastructure improvements necessary to promote economic development and to provide safe mobility for pedestrians and vehicles. The project will upgrade Alley-1, Alley -2, and Alley-3 around the Howard Theater area.","justification":"The pavement condition on T and Wilterberger Sts. and the alleys is very poor, and there is no surface drainage system. Also the sidewalk condition is not up to standard.  Improvements will complement private sector investment in this historic area.","progress_assessment":"This project is progressing as planned but more coordination with WASA is needed to address the existing water main system.","related_projects":"This project is within the Great Streetsâ€“Lower Georgia Avenue project limits.  The Radio One and Howard Town Center projects are adjacent.","milestones":{"environmental_approvals":{},"design_start":{"actual":"07/09/07"},"design_complete":{"projected":"03/15/09"},"construction_start":{"projected":"10/15/09"},"construction_complete":{"projected":"10/15/09"},"closeout":{"projected":"01/15/11"}},"useful_life":30,"facility":"HOWARD THEATER","est_cost":0,"lat":38.91533954,"lon":-77.02109317,"first_year":2010,"last_year":2012,"cip_history":{"FY2010":{"plan":{"FY2010":1200,"FY2011":2300,"FY2012":2300,"FY2013":0,"FY2014":0,"FY2015":0},"est_cost":null},"FY2011":{"plan":{"FY2011":2300,"FY2012":2300,"FY2013":0,"FY2014":0,"FY2015":0,"FY2016":0},"est_cost":null},"FY2012":{"plan":{"FY2012":2300,"FY2013":0,"FY2014":0,"FY2015":0,"FY2016":0,"FY2017":0},"est_cost":0}},"cumulative_funding":{"funding_by_phase":{"(01) Design":{"FY2010":{"allotted":350,"spent":31,"proposed":0},"FY2011":{"allotted":350,"spent":88,"proposed":0},"FY2012":{"allotted":350,"spent":119,"proposed":0}},"(03) Project Management":{"FY2010":{"allotted":500,"spent":500,"proposed":0},"FY2011":{"allotted":500,"spent":500,"proposed":0},"FY2012":{"allotted":500,"spent":500,"proposed":0}},"(04) Construction":{"FY2010":{"allotted":1350,"spent":0,"proposed":1200},"FY2011":{"allotted":2550,"spent":0,"proposed":2300},"FY2012":{"allotted":4850,"spent":0,"proposed":2300}}},"funding_by_source":{"GO Bonds - New (0300)":{"FY2010":{"allotted":2200,"spent":531,"proposed":1200},"FY2011":{"allotted":3400,"spent":588,"proposed":2300},"FY2012":{"allotted":5700,"spent":619,"proposed":2300}}},"total_funding":{"FY2010":{"allotted":2200,"spent":531,"proposed":1200},"FY2011":{"allotted":3400,"spent":588,"proposed":2300},"FY2012":{"allotted":5700,"spent":619,"proposed":2300}}}}
