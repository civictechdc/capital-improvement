The District Department of Transportation (DDOT) has developed an annual work (construction) schedule that continuously assesses the needs of every local street in the District.Depending on the condition of the roadway, DDOT will provide service from basic mill and overlay (for resurfacing needs) to complete reconstruction and upgrade.  Regardless of the construction type, DDOT’s focus is to also repair or replace the adjacent sidewalks, curbs, and gutters in conjunction to the street repair, if applicable. In addition, DDOT has established a ward based contract which allows timely and successful implementation and execution of work plans.  Annual work (construction) plans are based on the available funding and fulfill the Mayor's initiatives and objectives and benefits the residents as well.There is a separate road reconstruction project for each ward.","justification":"DDOT’s goal is to preserve our current roadway system and provide maintenance as needed.  This service helps to avoid the more costlyreconstruction and upgrading repairs. DDOT’s local roads are an integral part of the Districts infrastructure system.  Residents, commuters, tourists, and those in the business community rely on DDOT for the city’s streets to be safe, reliable and functional, thus the maintenance of these roads is critical. This project aligns with SustainableDC Actions: Transportation 2.1 and 2.4.","progress_assessment":"DDOT develops an annual construction plan based on the approved budget.  This construction plan serves not only as the plan for which a construction schedule is adhered to but the is made available to the public so that they can become aware of when DDOT will be in their community to begin construction.","related_projects":"DDOT’s in-house (project CE302) staff can address minor resurfacing and maintenance needs but can not handle the volume of construction required based on DDOT’s work plan.There is a separate road construction project for each ward.","milestones":{"environmental_approvals":{},"design_start":{},"design_complete":{},"construction_start":{},"construction_complete":{},"closeout":{}},"useful_life":30,"est_cost":38784000,"facility":"LOCAL STREETS","lat":null,"lon":null,"first_year":2010,"last_year":2022,"cip_history":{"FY2010":{"plan":{"FY2010":218,"FY2011":218,"FY2012":218,"FY2013":218,"FY2014":218,"FY2015":218},"est_cost":null},"FY2011":{"plan":{"FY2011":894,"FY2012":894,"FY2013":894,"FY2014":785,"FY2015":785,"FY2016":894},"est_cost":null},"FY2012":{"plan":{"FY2012":558,"FY2013":758,"FY2014":609,"FY2015":604,"FY2016":714,"FY2017":714},"est_cost":0},"FY2013":{"plan":{"FY2013":758,"FY2014":604,"FY2015":604,"FY2016":714,"FY2017":714,"FY2018":800},"est_cost":16370000},"FY2014":{"plan":{"FY2014":738,"FY2015":639,"FY2016":659,"FY2017":692,"FY2018":1050,"FY2019":1176},"est_cost":17888000},"FY2015":{"plan":{"FY2015":1000,"FY2016":554,"FY2017":533,"FY2018":610,"FY2019":1440,"FY2020":1414},"est_cost":19223000},"FY2016":{"plan":{"FY2016":1628,"FY2017":1356,"FY2018":1360,"FY2019":1500,"FY2020":1726,"FY2021":1848},"est_cost":24536000},"FY2017":{"plan":{"FY2017":1350,"FY2018":2914,"FY2019":1349,"FY2020":4750,"FY2021":5328,"FY2022":3625},"est_cost":38784000}},"cumulative_funding":{"funding_by_phase":{"(01) Design":{"FY2010":{"allotted":155,"spent":155,"proposed":0},"FY2011":{"allotted":161,"spent":156,"proposed":0},"FY2012":{"allotted":316,"spent":310,"proposed":0},"FY2013":{"allotted":316,"spent":310,"proposed":0},"FY2014":{"allotted":316,"spent":310,"proposed":0},"FY2015":{"allotted":310,"spent":310,"proposed":0},"FY2016":{"allotted":310,"spent":307,"proposed":34},"FY2017":{"allotted":343,"spent":312,"proposed":0},"FY2018":{"allotted":343,"spent":312,"proposed":0},"FY2019":{"allotted":343,"spent":312,"proposed":0},"FY2020":{"allotted":343,"spent":312,"proposed":0},"FY2021":{"allotted":343,"spent":312,"proposed":0},"FY2022":{"allotted":343,"spent":312,"proposed":0}},"(03) Project Management":{"FY2010":{"allotted":1322,"spent":1322,"proposed":0},"FY2011":{"allotted":487,"spent":393,"proposed":336},"FY2012":{"allotted":2145,"spent":1972,"proposed":119},"FY2013":{"allotted":2264,"spent":2077,"proposed":106},"FY2014":{"allotted":2370,"spent":2097,"proposed":183},"FY2015":{"allotted":2362,"spent":2170,"proposed":821},"FY2016":{"allotted":3628,"spent":2424,"proposed":0},"FY2017":{"allotted":3628,"spent":2493,"proposed":36},"FY2018":{"allotted":3664,"spent":2493,"proposed":1914},"FY2019":{"allotted":5578,"spent":2493,"proposed":1247},"FY2020":{"allotted":6825,"spent":2493,"proposed":3750},"FY2021":{"allotted":10575,"spent":2493,"proposed":3750},"FY2022":{"allotted":14325,"spent":2493,"proposed":3625}},"(04) Construction":{"FY2010":{"allotted":387,"spent":356,"proposed":218},"FY2011":{"allotted":7562,"spent":7455,"proposed":558},"FY2012":{"allotted":8725,"spent":8582,"proposed":439},"FY2013":{"allotted":9597,"spent":9339,"proposed":652},"FY2014":{"allotted":10249,"spent":10237,"proposed":555},"FY2015":{"allotted":11001,"spent":10937,"proposed":179},"FY2016":{"allotted":11180,"spent":10529,"proposed":1594},"FY2017":{"allotted":15497,"spent":14562,"proposed":1314},"FY2018":{"allotted":16811,"spent":14562,"proposed":1000},"FY2019":{"allotted":17811,"spent":14562,"proposed":102},"FY2020":{"allotted":17913,"spent":14562,"proposed":1000},"FY2021":{"allotted":18913,"spent":14562,"proposed":1578},"FY2022":{"allotted":20491,"spent":14562,"proposed":0}}},"funding_by_source":{"GO Bonds -
