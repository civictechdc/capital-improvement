The project will enable the Department of Mental Health to vacate most of the currently occupied buildings on the East Campus, enabling the District to develop the balance of the campus for mixed use.

This project is a US District Court and Department of Justice-monitored project.","progress_assessment":"This project is experiencing time delays due to unanticipated obstacles, including contaminated soil, and plan improvements such as additional communications and technology infrastructure.","related_projects":"Project XA537C - St Elizabeths Hospital General Improvements.","milestones":{"environmental_approvals":{},"design_start":{},"design_complete":{"projected":"09/30/06","actual":"09/30/06"},"construction_start":{"projected":"12/01/06"},"construction_complete":{"projected":"09/30/10"},"closeout":{"projected":"11/30/10"}},"useful_life":50,"facility":"NEW MENTAL HEALTH HOSPITAL","lat":38.85068463,"lon":-76.99472857,"first_year":2010,"last_year":2011,"cip_history":{"FY2010":{"FY2010":12770,"FY2011":0,"FY2012":0,"FY2013":0,"FY2014":0,"FY2015":0},"FY2011":{"FY2011":12500,"FY2012":0,"FY2013":0,"FY2014":0,"FY2015":0,"FY2016":0}},"cumulative_funding":{"funding_by_phase":{"(03) Project Management":{"FY2010":{"allotted":213480,"spent":178450,"proposed":12770},"FY2011":{"allotted":218490,"spent":197228,"proposed":12500}},"(04) Construction":{"FY2010":{"allotted":188701,"spent":160906,"proposed":0},"FY2011":{"allotted":180941,"spent":173326,"proposed":12500}},"(05) Equipment":{"FY2010":{"allotted":7485,"spent":286,"proposed":12770},"FY2011":{"allotted":20255,"spent":6644,"proposed":0}}},"funding_by_source":{"GO Bonds - New (0300)":{"FY2010":{"allotted":34800,"spent":9358,"proposed":12770},"FY2011":{"allotted":39810,"spent":20929,"proposed":12500}},"Certificate of Participation (0340)":{"FY2010":{"allotted":178679,"spent":169091,"proposed":0},"FY2011":{"allotted":178679,"spent":176299,"proposed":0}}},"total_funding":{"FY2010":{"allotted":213480,"spent":178450,"proposed":12770},"FY2011":{"allotted":218490,"spent":197228,"proposed":12500}}},"est_cost":230990000}
