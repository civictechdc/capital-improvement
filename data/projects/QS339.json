The site contains several athletic fields and courts, as well as playgrounds and unstructured open space. Demand for these amenities has been steadily increasing in recent years, placing greater pressure on the services that can only be provided by a fully functional recreation center. Renovation and/or replacement of the existing facility will provide greater recreational amenities and support for District taxpayers.","justification":"Edgewood Recreation Center was built in the 1940s and is a one-room structure; it is both too old and too small to support the recreational needs of the community. The site contains several athletic fields and courts, as well as playgrounds and unstructured open space. Renovation/replacement of the New York Avenue facility is consistent with the Mayor’s objectives to preserve and enhance the District’s public open spaces, athletic fields, and landscaped parks, as well as to promote recreational opportunities for all age groups that enhance physical, social, and cultural development.","progress_assessment":"Upgrades to the existing facility will be complete in spring 2010. Additional capital improvements will be completed as funding allows.","related_projects":"none","milestones":{"environmental_approvals":{},"design_start":{"projected":"06/10/09"},"design_complete":{"projected":"12/31/09","actual":"12/31/09"},"construction_start":{"projected":"10/01/12"},"construction_complete":{"projected":"11/01/13"},"closeout":{"projected":"01/31/14"}},"useful_life":20,"facility":"EDGEWOOD RECREATION CENTER","lat":38.92472468,"lon":-77.00202678,"first_year":2010,"last_year":2011,"cip_history":{"FY2010":{"plan":{"FY2010":0,"FY2011":0,"FY2012":1500,"FY2013":10000,"FY2014":2000,"FY2015":0},"est_cost":null},"FY2011":{"plan":{"FY2011":6200,"FY2012":2500,"FY2013":0,"FY2014":0,"FY2015":0,"FY2016":0},"est_cost":null}},"cumulative_funding":{"funding_by_phase":{"(01) Design":{"FY2010":{"allotted":500,"spent":500,"proposed":0},"FY2011":{"allotted":500,"spent":399,"proposed":6084}},"(03) Project Management":{"FY2011":{"allotted":0,"spent":0,"proposed":116}}},"funding_by_source":{"GO Bonds - New (0300)":{"FY2010":{"allotted":500,"spent":500,"proposed":0},"FY2011":{"allotted":500,"spent":399,"proposed":6200}}},"total_funding":{"FY2010":{"allotted":500,"spent":500,"proposed":0},"FY2011":{"allotted":500,"spent":399,"proposed":6200}}},"est_cost":6700000}
