The facility will meet the needs outlined in the five focus areas of library activity envisioned by DCPL, as a service to children and teens; library as a community place; books and other library materials; technology; and adult literacy and learning. The project will also consist of providing between 3,500 to 5,000 square feet of interim/temporary/swing space in order to assure continued library services during construction activities.The renovated Cleveland Park Neighborhood Library will reflect the program and goals of the library and the needs of the District of Columbia residents who use it. The building will incorporate forward-thinking approaches to urban design, architecture, engineering and environmentaltechnologies in the public realm. The  Cleveland Park Library will be a destination that will attract and support hundreds of users per day, and promote a vibrant, mixed-use neighborhood and active street environment.","justification":"N/A","progress_assessment":"Project is ongoing.","related_projects":"N/A","milestones":{"environmental_approvals":{},"design_start":{"projected":"01/30/15"},"design_complete":{"projected":"01/30/16"},"construction_start":{"projected":"03/03/16"},"construction_complete":{"projected":"05/05/17"},"closeout":{"projected":"09/30/17"}},"est_cost":19770000,"useful_life":30,"lat":38.9338158,"lon":-77.05784258,"first_year":2012,"last_year":2017,"cip_history":{"FY2012":{"plan":{"FY2012":0,"FY2013":0,"FY2014":0,"FY2015":0,"FY2016":0,"FY2017":2300},"est_cost":7750050},"FY2013":{"plan":{"FY2013":0,"FY2014":0,"FY2015":0,"FY2016":0,"FY2017":2300,"FY2018":0},"est_cost":2300000},"FY2014":{"plan":{"FY2014":0,"FY2015":5225,"FY2016":10000,"FY2017":0,"FY2018":0,"FY2019":0},"est_cost":15225000},"FY2015":{"plan":{"FY2015":5625,"FY2016":12595,"FY2017":450,"FY2018":0,"FY2019":0,"FY2020":0},"est_cost":18670000},"FY2016":{"plan":{"FY2016":12595,"FY2017":450,"FY2018":0,"FY2019":0,"FY2020":0,"FY2021":0},"est_cost":18670000},"FY2017":{"plan":{"FY2017":1550,"FY2018":0,"FY2019":0,"FY2020":0,"FY2021":0,"FY2022":0},"est_cost":19770000}},"cumulative_funding":{"funding_by_phase":{"(01) Design":{"FY2012":{"allotted":0,"spent":0,"proposed":0},"FY2015":{"allotted":0,"spent":0,"proposed":1706},"FY2016":{"allotted":1350,"spent":1338,"proposed":0},"FY2017":{"allotted":1350,"spent":1338,"proposed":0}},"(02) SITE":{"FY2012":{"allotted":0,"spent":0,"proposed":0},"FY2015":{"allotted":0,"spent":0,"proposed":0},"FY2016":{"allotted":600,"spent":0,"proposed":445},"FY2017":{"allotted":1045,"spent":759,"proposed":0}},"(03) Project Management":{"FY2012":{"allotted":0,"spent":0,"proposed":0},"FY2015":{"allotted":0,"spent":0,"proposed":3919},"FY2016":{"allotted":2675,"spent":510,"proposed":1600},"FY2017":{"allotted":4275,"spent":936,"proposed":0}},"(04) Construction":{"FY2013":{"allotted":0,"spent":0,"proposed":0},"FY2014":{"allotted":0,"spent":0,"proposed":0},"FY2015":{"allotted":0,"spent":0,"proposed":0},"FY2016":{"allotted":1000,"spent":754,"proposed":10550},"FY2017":{"allotted":11550,"spent":1194,"proposed":1550}}},"funding_by_source":{"GO Bonds - New (0300)":{"FY2012":{"allotted":0,"spent":0,"proposed":0},"FY2014":{"allotted":0,"spent":0,"proposed":0},"FY2015":{"allotted":0,"spent":0,"proposed":5625},"FY2016":{"allotted":5625,"spent":3094,"proposed":12595},"FY2017":{"allotted":18220,"spent":4227,"proposed":1100}},"Sales of Assets (0305)":{"FY2013":{"allotted":0,"spent":0,"proposed":0}},"Pay Go (0301)":{"FY2017":{"allotted":0,"spent":0,"proposed":450}}},"total_funding":{"FY2012":{"allotted":0,"spent":0,"proposed":0},"FY2015":{"allotted":0,"spent":0,"proposed":5625},"FY2016":{"allotted":5625,"spent":2602,"proposed":12595},"FY2017":{"allotted":18220,"spent":4227,"proposed":1550},"FY2013":{"allotted":0,"spent":0,"proposed":0},"FY2014":{"allotted":0,"spent":0,"proposed":0}}}}
