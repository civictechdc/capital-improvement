The locker room space is overwhelmed at the conclusion of any class, and it does not have enough room to accommodate guests and their aides.  The physical size of the Center limits the number of District residents it can help.  Expanding the physical size of the Center would increase its capacity, ensuring that more residents who need its services could have access to them.  The Center serves a vulnerable segment of District society; renovations are needed to better enable it to continue serving this role.","progress_assessment":"Ongoing project.","related_projects":"NA","milestones":{"environmental_approvals":{"projected":"06/15/16"},"design_start":{"projected":"11/09/15"},"design_complete":{"projected":"09/01/16"},"construction_start":{"projected":"12/02/20"},"construction_complete":{"projected":"03/01/21"},"closeout":{"projected":"04/01/21"}},"est_cost":20000000,"useful_life":30,"lat":38.88087191,"lon":-76.96320323,"first_year":2015,"last_year":2021,"cip_history":{"FY2015":{"FY2015":1500,"FY2016":6500,"FY2017":0,"FY2018":0,"FY2019":0,"FY2020":0},"FY2017":{"FY2017":0,"FY2018":0,"FY2019":0,"FY2020":9000,"FY2021":9500,"FY2022":0}},"cumulative_funding":{"funding_by_phase":{"(01) Design":{"FY2015":{"allotted":0,"spent":0,"proposed":1500},"FY2017":{"allotted":1500,"spent":1500,"proposed":0},"FY2018":{"allotted":1500,"spent":1500,"proposed":0},"FY2019":{"allotted":1500,"spent":1500,"proposed":0},"FY2020":{"allotted":1500,"spent":1500,"proposed":9000},"FY2021":{"allotted":10500,"spent":1500,"proposed":9500}},"(03) Project Management":{"FY2017":{"allotted":52,"spent":52,"proposed":0},"FY2018":{"allotted":52,"spent":52,"proposed":0},"FY2019":{"allotted":52,"spent":52,"proposed":0},"FY2020":{"allotted":52,"spent":52,"proposed":0},"FY2021":{"allotted":52,"spent":52,"proposed":0}}},"funding_by_source":{"GO Bonds - New (0300)":{"FY2015":{"allotted":0,"spent":0,"proposed":1500},"FY2017":{"allotted":1500,"spent":1500,"proposed":0},"FY2018":{"allotted":1500,"spent":1500,"proposed":0},"FY2019":{"allotted":1500,"spent":1500,"proposed":0},"FY2020":{"allotted":1500,"spent":1500,"proposed":9000},"FY2021":{"allotted":10500,"spent":1500,"proposed":9500}}},"total_funding":{"FY2015":{"allotted":0,"spent":0,"proposed":1500},"FY2017":{"allotted":1500,"spent":1500,"proposed":0},"FY2018":{"allotted":1500,"spent":1500,"proposed":0},"FY2019":{"allotted":1500,"spent":1500,"proposed":0},"FY2020":{"allotted":1500,"spent":1500,"proposed":9000},"FY2021":{"allotted":10500,"spent":1500,"proposed":9500}}}}
