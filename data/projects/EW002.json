When completed in mid-2013, the project will:    • Improve mobility by providing separate freeway and local traffic connections to both directions of DC 295, the Southeast-Southwest Freeway and local streets on both sides of the Anacostia River,   • Provide a shared path for pedestrians and bicycles, as well as rails to allow future streetcar connections,   • Replace the existing functionally deficient and structurally obsolete bridges,   • Provide an additional alternate evacuation route from our Nation’s Capital, and   • Include new trail connections, improved drainage and other environmental investments.   Projected to serve almost 180,000 vehicles per day by 2030, the existing bridges lack connections to allow travel directly from southbound DC 295/Anacostia Freeway to the Southeast-Southwest Freeway or from the Southeast-Southwest Freeway to northbound DC 295. The two new freeway bridges will provide these connections. The third bridge will carry local traffic between city streets on both sides of the river and provide additional connections to both directions of DC 295.  The project is the largest ever constructed by DDOT and is the first river bridge replacement in the District in more than 40 years.","justification":"This project will improve mobility by providing separate freeway and local traffic connections to both directions of DC 295, the Southeast-Southwest Freeway and local streets on both sides of the Anacostia River.","progress_assessment":"Planned completion is mid-2013.","related_projects":"CD034A-11TH ST SE BRIDGE OV SE FREEWAY; CD055A-1TH ST, SE BRIDGES; CDO56A-1TH ST, SE BRIDGES; CDT57A-11TH ST BR INTERCHANGE IM-2952(166); CDT68A-11TH ST BR OVER ANA RIVER IM-2952(173); CDTA2A-11TH ST BRIDGES OVER ANACOSTIA IM-2952(1; EW001C-11TH ST BRIDGE; HTF00A-11TH STREET BRIDGE; and HTF02A-11TH ST BRIDGE","milestones":{"environmental_approvals":{},"design_start":{},"design_complete":{"projected":"04/01/10"},"construction_start":{"projected":"09/01/09"},"construction_complete":{"projected":"12/01/14"},"closeout":{"projected":"03/01/15"}},"ward":"","facility":"11TH STREET BRIDGE","est_cost":300000000,"useful_life":40,"lat":null,"lon":null,"first_year":2011,"last_year":2013,"cip_history":{"FY2011":{"FY2011":100000,"FY2012":0,"FY2013":50000,"FY2014":0,"FY2015":0,"FY2016":0},"FY2012":{"FY2012":0,"FY2013":50000,"FY2014":0,"FY2015":0,"FY2016":0,"FY2017":0},"FY2013":{"FY2013":50000,"FY2014":0,"FY2015":0,"FY2016":0,"FY2017":0,"FY2018":0}},"cumulative_funding":{"funding_by_phase":{"(04) Construction":{"FY2011":{"allotted":65000,"spent":64897,"proposed":100000},"FY2012":{"allotted":194927,"spent":187574,"proposed":0},"FY2013":{"allotted":180418,"spent":179763,"proposed":50000}},"(00) Feasibility Studies":{"FY2012":{"allotted":6000,"spent":5358,"proposed":0},"FY2013":{"allotted":6000,"spent":5483,"proposed":0}},"(01) Design":{"FY2012":{"allotted":9121,"spent":8960,"proposed":0},"FY2013":{"allotted":9121,"spent":9019,"proposed":0}},"(03) Project Management":{"FY2012":{"allotted":11681,"spent":11664,"proposed":0},"FY2013":{"allotted":11681,"spent":11681,"proposed":0}}},"funding_by_source":{"GO Bonds - New (0300)":{"FY2011":{"allotted":65000,"spent":64897,"proposed":0},"FY2012":{"allotted":85000,"spent":79271,"proposed":0},"FY2013":{"allotted":70492,"spent":70456,"proposed":0}},"GARVEE Bonds (0310)":{"FY2011":{"allotted":0,"spent":0,"proposed":100000},"FY2012":{"allotted":80000,"spent":80000,"proposed":0},"FY2013":{"allotted":80000,"spent":80000,"proposed":50000}},"Local Transportation Revenue (0330)":{"FY2012":{"allotted":3550,"spent":2805,"proposed":0},"FY2013":{"allotted":3550,"spent":3550,"proposed":0}},"Local Sts - PAYGO (0331)":{"FY2012":{"allotted":4171,"spent":4171,"proposed":0},"FY2013":{"allotted":4171,"spent":4171,"proposed":0}},"Local Sts - Parking Tax (0332)":{"FY2012":{"allotted":22205,"spent":21326,"proposed":0},"FY2013":{"allotted":22205,"spent":21789,"proposed":0}}},"total_funding":{"FY2011":{"allotted":65000,"spent":64897,"proposed":100000},"FY2012":{"allotted":194927,"spent":187574,"proposed":0},"FY2013":{"allotted":180418,"spent":179763,"proposed":50000}}}}
