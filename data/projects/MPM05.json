Utilizing a data warehouse for data analysis and trending would greatly improve the Districtâ€™s ability to manage the Medicaid program. In order to facilitate more efficient Medicaid program administration and support intelligent decision-making, DHCF needs a Medicaid Data Warehouse (MDW) to provide easy access to Medicaid program data from the Medicaid Management Information System (MMIS) through the use of analytical reporting tools.","justification":"The District must begin to maintain a warehouse with the ability to pull information electronically.","progress_assessment":"This is a new project.","related_projects":"MPM04C-MEDICAID DATA WAREHOUSE, MPM03C-MMIS UPGRADED SYSTEM","milestones":{"environmental_approvals":{},"design_start":{"projected":"01/01/13"},"design_complete":{},"construction_start":{},"construction_complete":{"projected":"09/30/15"},"closeout":{}},"est_cost":9800000,"useful_life":10,"lat":38.90109408,"lon":-77.00844776,"first_year":2013,"last_year":2015,"cip_history":{"FY2013":{"plan":{"FY2013":0,"FY2014":400,"FY2015":400,"FY2016":0,"FY2017":0,"FY2018":0},"est_cost":800000},"FY2014":{"plan":{"FY2014":400,"FY2015":400,"FY2016":0,"FY2017":0,"FY2018":0,"FY2019":0},"est_cost":9800000},"FY2015":{"plan":{"FY2015":400,"FY2016":0,"FY2017":0,"FY2018":0,"FY2019":0,"FY2020":0},"est_cost":9800000}},"cumulative_funding":{"funding_by_phase":{"(06) IT Requirements Development/Systems Design":{"FY2013":{"allotted":0,"spent":0,"proposed":0},"FY2014":{"allotted":9000,"spent":0,"proposed":400},"FY2015":{"allotted":9400,"spent":1397,"proposed":400}}},"funding_by_source":{"GO Bonds - New (0300)":{"FY2013":{"allotted":0,"spent":0,"proposed":0},"FY2014":{"allotted":0,"spent":0,"proposed":400},"FY2015":{"allotted":400,"spent":370,"proposed":400}},"Federal (0350)":{"FY2014":{"allotted":9000,"spent":0,"proposed":0},"FY2015":{"allotted":9000,"spent":1026,"proposed":0}}},"total_funding":{"FY2013":{"allotted":0,"spent":0,"proposed":0},"FY2014":{"allotted":9000,"spent":0,"proposed":400},"FY2015":{"allotted":9400,"spent":1397,"proposed":400}}}}
