CityDW works with the City Administrator, DCStat and with District agencies to supply data, business intelligence tools and dashboards.  CityDW gathers data and builds reporting environments for DCStat (http://capstat.oca.dc.gov/DC.aspx) and agencies like CFSA, DDOT, OUC (311 and 991 data).  CityDW also builds custom applications and dashboards to display the data like internal reporting and tracking tools like TrackDC (a public version will be released in FY10).   CityDW, being the centralized location for a large amount of city data, is also charged with making, the data available to the public.  One example is the District’s Data Catalog that provides over 400 datasets in easy to access formats (spreadsheets, Google Maps, Google Earth).  For years the District of Columbia has provided public access to city operational data through the Internet to help agencies operate as more responsive, better performing organizations. The Data Catalog can be used to view or download a variety of data like crimes, service requests, procurements, permits, constructions projects, purchase card transactions, purchase orders and more.","justification":"Information is one of the most under-utilized assets in government. Without the proper data sharing in place, agencies often bear all costs associated with collecting, storing, and protecting data without realizing any noticeable benefits. CityDW gathers and makes this data available to the Office of the City Administrator, agencies, employees and citizens. CityDW was selected from over 700 applicants by the Ash Institute as the winner of the 2009 Innovations in American Government Award in Urban Policy.","progress_assessment":"CityDW now publishes over 400 datasets via the Data Catalog (http://data.octo.dc.gov/), and built four applications that are available to the public that make it easy to access and view data including crime and service requests on a map.","related_projects":"Projects that CityDW depends on include but are not limited to Citizen Interaction and Relationship Management, DCGIS, PeopleSoft, PASS, and MPD crime data systems and all other agency source databases that provide data.","milestones":{"environmental_approvals":{},"design_start":{"projected":"01/01/05","actual":"01/01/05"},"design_complete":{"projected":"12/01/05","actual":"12/01/05"},"construction_start":{"projected":"12/01/17"},"construction_complete":{"projected":"12/31/20"},"closeout":{}},"useful_life":5,"facility":"INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY","ward":"","est_cost":5490000,"lat":null,"lon":null,"first_year":2010,"last_year":2014,"cip_history":{"FY2010":{"FY2010":850,"FY2011":713,"FY2012":1325,"FY2013":1350,"FY2014":1162,"FY2015":1500},"FY2011":{"FY2011":713,"FY2012":1000,"FY2013":500,"FY2014":581,"FY2015":350,"FY2016":1540},"FY2012":{"FY2012":500,"FY2013":500,"FY2014":581,"FY2015":350,"FY2016":1540,"FY2017":2006},"FY2013":{"FY2013":0,"FY2014":581,"FY2015":0,"FY2016":1140,"FY2017":2006,"FY2018":0},"FY2014":{"FY2014":581,"FY2015":0,"FY2016":0,"FY2017":0,"FY2018":0,"FY2019":0}},"cumulative_funding":{"funding_by_phase":{"(05) Equipment":{"FY2010":{"allotted":2722,"spent":2387,"proposed":850},"FY2011":{"allotted":3572,"spent":2365,"proposed":713},"FY2012":{"allotted":4409,"spent":4116,"proposed":500},"FY2013":{"allotted":4909,"spent":4207,"proposed":0},"FY2014":{"allotted":4909,"spent":4839,"proposed":581}},"(07) IT Development & Testing":{"FY2010":{"allotted":2131,"spent":1796,"proposed":850},"FY2011":{"allotted":2981,"spent":1862,"proposed":598},"FY2013":{"allotted":4088,"spent":3549,"proposed":0},"FY2014":{"allotted":4088,"spent":4061,"proposed":0}},"(07) IT Development Testing":{"FY2012":{"allotted":3703,"spent":3535,"proposed":385}}},"funding_by_source":{"Equipment Lease (0302)":{"FY2010":{"allotted":2722,"spent":2387,"proposed":850},"FY2011":{"allotted":3572,"spent":2365,"proposed":713},"FY2012":{"allotted":4409,"spent":4117,"proposed":500},"FY2013":{"allotted":4909,"spent":4207,"proposed":0},"FY2014":{"allotted":4909,"spent":4893,"proposed":581}}},"total_funding":{"FY2010":{"allotted":2722,"spent":2387,"proposed":850},"FY2011":{"allotted":3572,"spent":2365,"proposed":713},"FY2012":{"allotted":4409,"spent":4116,"proposed":500},"FY2013":{"allotted":4909,"spent":4207,"proposed":0},"FY2014":{"allotted":4909,"spent":4839,"proposed":581}}}}
