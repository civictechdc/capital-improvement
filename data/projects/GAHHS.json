{"active":true,"project_no":"GAHHS","title":"HEALTHY SCHOOL YARDS","agency":"DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA PUBLIC SCHOOLS (GA0)","implementing_agency":"DEPARTMENT OF GENERAL SERVICES (AM0)","location":"DISTRICT-WIDE","facility":"VARIOUS","status":"Ongoing Subprojects","description":"Description: Presently dozens of DCPS schoolyards, most of which are in the districts most under-served neighborhoods, are in immediate need of modernization. This project will create high performing schoolyards that foster the health and wellness of our students as well as contribute directly to the city environmental sustainability mandates. High performance schoolyards will provide students and schools with safe and modern play structures, gardens, well designed and easier to maintain play fields, and outdoor/environmental learning opportunities, on sites that meet high environmental standards. The environmental standards of the sites will address a plethora of problems such as the storm water management crisis perpetuated in part by the vast expanse of DCPS hardscape. Under this aspect of the project, schoolyards will retain a much greater percentage of storm-water runoff and help mitigate the need for the city to invest in other abatement initiatives. The project will also expose youth to how to become more responsible stewards of the environment. The project would be implemented in coordination with DDOE and help support the Healthy Schools Act.","justification":"See MFP","progress_assessment":"Ongoing project.","related_projects":"See MFP","milestones":{"environmental_approvals":{},"design_start":{},"design_complete":{},"construction_start":{},"construction_complete":{},"closeout":{}},"est_cost":6000000,"useful_life":30,"lat":null,"lon":null,"first_year":2017,"last_year":2022,"cip_history":{"FY2017":{"FY2017":0,"FY2018":0,"FY2019":2000,"FY2020":0,"FY2021":0,"FY2022":2000}},"cumulative_funding":{"funding_by_phase":{"(04) Construction":{"FY2017":{"allotted":2000,"spent":2000,"proposed":0},"FY2018":{"allotted":2000,"spent":2000,"proposed":0},"FY2019":{"allotted":2000,"spent":2000,"proposed":2000},"FY2020":{"allotted":4000,"spent":2000,"proposed":0},"FY2021":{"allotted":4000,"spent":2000,"proposed":0},"FY2022":{"allotted":4000,"spent":2000,"proposed":2000}}},"funding_by_source":{"GO Bonds - New (0300)":{"FY2017":{"allotted":2000,"spent":2000,"proposed":0},"FY2018":{"allotted":2000,"spent":2000,"proposed":0},"FY2019":{"allotted":2000,"spent":2000,"proposed":2000},"FY2020":{"allotted":4000,"spent":2000,"proposed":0},"FY2021":{"allotted":4000,"spent":2000,"proposed":0},"FY2022":{"allotted":4000,"spent":2000,"proposed":2000}}},"total_funding":{"FY2017":{"allotted":2000,"spent":2000,"proposed":0},"FY2018":{"allotted":2000,"spent":2000,"proposed":0},"FY2019":{"allotted":2000,"spent":2000,"proposed":2000},"FY2020":{"allotted":4000,"spent":2000,"proposed":0},"FY2021":{"allotted":4000,"spent":2000,"proposed":0},"FY2022":{"allotted":4000,"spent":2000,"proposed":2000}}}}
