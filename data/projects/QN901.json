The center is utilized for many community uses, although its potential for expansion is limited due to the small size of the park parcel. The center currently houses one multi-purpose room, which is inadequate due to the large number of DPR and community activities at the site. The Friends of 16th Street Heights Parks is actively engaged in advocating and improving both Upshur and Hamilton parks.","justification":"Expansion of a recreation center for this community is imperative, as the other recreation centers serving this area are also undersized. In order to meet the needs of the District residents, an updated facility must be provided. Renovation of this facility would help achieve the 2008 Performance Plan objectives.","progress_assessment":"None","related_projects":"none","milestones":{"environmental_approvals":{},"design_start":{},"design_complete":{"projected":"10/01/11","actual":"10/01/11"},"construction_start":{"projected":"04/01/14"},"construction_complete":{"projected":"11/01/14"},"closeout":{"projected":"01/31/16"}},"useful_life":25,"facility":"HAMILTON RECREATION CENTER","lat":38.95261414,"lon":-77.03133634,"first_year":2010,"last_year":2011,"cip_history":{"FY2010":{"plan":{"FY2010":0,"FY2011":0,"FY2012":1000,"FY2013":0,"FY2014":10000,"FY2015":0},"est_cost":null},"FY2011":{"plan":{"FY2011":0,"FY2012":0,"FY2013":0,"FY2014":2500,"FY2015":0,"FY2016":5000},"est_cost":null}},"cumulative_funding":{"funding_by_phase":{"(01) Design":{"FY2010":{"allotted":0,"spent":0,"proposed":0}},"(04) Construction":{"FY2010":{"allotted":0,"spent":0,"proposed":0},"FY2011":{"allotted":0,"spent":0,"proposed":0}},"(03) Project Management":{"FY2011":{"allotted":0,"spent":0,"proposed":0}}},"funding_by_source":{"GO Bonds - New (0300)":{"FY2010":{"allotted":0,"spent":0,"proposed":0},"FY2011":{"allotted":0,"spent":0,"proposed":0}}},"total_funding":{"FY2010":{"allotted":0,"spent":0,"proposed":0},"FY2011":{"allotted":0,"spent":0,"proposed":0}}},"est_cost":0}
