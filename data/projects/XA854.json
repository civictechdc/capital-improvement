The system will fully integrate care management applications used by the agency and the MHRS community.","justification":"The project will replace a DMH system that is 11 years old and is necessary to adjudicate $70M in public mental health claims annually and bill for $15M in revenue for the Department.  The system will act as an electronic medical record for more than 22,000 District consumers who access mental health services in DC.  Due because of the the age and instability of the current DMH system, it is critical that this system be implemented expeditiously.  The data from the system will enable DMH to serve District consumer better in the least restrict environment and also coordinate consumer's care amongst providers.  The increased health outcomes directly support the mayor's initiatives.","progress_assessment":"This project is on-going.
