The two-story brick structure requires total renovation and modernization to preserve and prolong the facility's useful life, as well as comply with current building and life safety codes.  Much of the building’s infrastructure is original and has exceeded its intended life.  The building’s electrical, plumbing, lighting, HVAC system, and living quarters are past useful service and will be replaced. The scope for this building includes repairing and restoring deteriorating exterior shell, replacing or refurbishing all windows and doors, installing a negative pressure gear room, renovating the basement, stabilizing the building's rear foundation, renovating the garage, and installing radiant strip heating. Code compliant fire alarm and fire sprinkler systems, an emergency generator, the roof and roof drainage systems will be replaced.  Interior improvements will include replacing and widening apparatus doors and installing a residential washer and dryer.  The kitchen, sleeping quarters, living quarters, bathrooms, showers and locker rooms will be replaced.  In the building exterior area the front apron and side alleys will be repaved and the new trench drains will be installed. Finally, an ADA compliant public restroom will be installed.  All renovations will be done to LEED Silver standard.","justification":"This project is necessary because of the poor condition of the station. This project will benefit the District taxpayers by having the fire and safety officials living and working in a code compliant and energy efficient building.
