{"active":false,"project_no":"N2501","title":"DATA CENTER RELOCATION","agency":"OFFICE OF CHIEF TECHNOLOGY OFFICER (TO0)","implementing_agency":"EQUIPMENT LEASE - CAPITAL (ELC)","location":"NORTHERN VIRGINIA","status":"Ongoing Subprojects","description":"The District of Columbia provides information technology services critical to public safety, public welfare, and government operations from its two primary data centers located within the District. This project will facilitate the relocation of the OCTO data centers to sites that are more secure, have robust infrastructure, and have sufficient capacity to meet current and future needs. The scope of the project is to find and prepare suitable data center sites, relocate the services to those sites, and support necessary capital improvements. One data center will be moved to a District-owned, recently constructed, highly secure site at the Unified Communications Center (UCC). The other data center will be moved to a state-of–the-art leased facility outside of the District of Columbia. Doing so will eliminate current issues with space and power capacity, as well as improve the District’s disaster recovery capability.","justification":"This project is necessary and urgent because both data centers no longer have sufficient space and power available to meet current and future demands, their infrastructures are old and in need of costly major upgrades, and they are too close together for Disaster Recovery purposes. As the current data centers are only five (5) miles apart, a serious incident may affect both. Leasing a facility outside the District will mitigate this risk.","progress_assessment":"OCP (DRES) in cooperation with OCTO released and awarded an RFP for the lease of data center facility in northern VA.  The lease was signed in August of 2009. Migration of data center services to the new leased facility will commence throughout FY 2010.  DRES working in conjunction with OCTO has selected an A&E firm for the Design/Build of the data center space within the UCC.    Since 2012 migrated and consolidated several District agencies (Department of Employment   Services, Department of Housing and Community Development, Child and Family Services   Agency, and Department of General Services) to the OCTO data centers, resulting in lower operational and maintenance costs, as these agencies no longer had to support and maintain their own disparate/silo datacenter.  The data center consolidation effort is an ongoing effort which has significantly lowered the District's server footprint. In FY12 alone this effort has resulted in the decommissioning of three OCTO-operated data centers and migration of over 300 servers to OCTO's 'greener' data centers, resulting in a net savings for the District.","related_projects":"N9001C-DC Government New Data Center Build-out, N2201C - Server Consolidation, N2702C - Enterprise Messaging and Communications Platform, and N1705C - Information Infrastructure.","milestones":{"environmental_approvals":{},"design_start":{"projected":"10/01/08","actual":"10/01/08"},"design_complete":{"projected":"09/30/10","actual":"09/30/10"},"construction_start":{"projected":"09/30/09","actual":"08/17/09"},"construction_complete":{"projected":"12/31/21"},"closeout":{"projected":"09/30/20"}},"useful_life":15,"ward":"","facility":"DATA CENTER","est_cost":17360000,"lat":null,"lon":null,"first_year":2010,"last_year":2015,"cip_history":{"FY2010":{"plan":{"FY2010":2500,"FY2011":12500,"FY2012":1000,"FY2013":1000,"FY2014":1000,"FY2015":0},"est_cost":null},"FY2011":{"plan":{"FY2011":12500,"FY2012":500,"FY2013":500,"FY2014":500,"FY2015":0,"FY2016":0},"est_cost":null},"FY2012":{"plan":{"FY2012":500,"FY2013":500,"FY2014":0,"FY2015":0,"FY2016":0,"FY2017":0},"est_cost":22633000},"FY2013":{"plan":{"FY2013":0,"FY2014":500,"FY2015":500,"FY2016":1000,"FY2017":0,"FY2018":800},"est_cost":19097000},"FY2014":{"plan":{"FY2014":500,"FY2015":500,"FY2016":0,"FY2017":0,"FY2018":0,"FY2019":0},"est_cost":17540000},"FY2015":{"plan":{"FY2015":320,"FY2016":0,"FY2017":0,"FY2018":0,"FY2019":0,"FY2020":0},"est_cost":17360000}},"cumulative_funding":{"funding_by_phase":{"(05) Equipment":{"FY2010":{"allotted":4633,"spent":4633,"proposed":2500},"FY2011":{"allotted":7133,"spent":6342,"proposed":12500},"FY2012":{"allotted":15797,"spent":12620,"proposed":500},"FY2013":{"allotted":14629,"spent":12884,"proposed":0},"FY2014":{"allotted":16540,"spent":16222,"proposed":500},"FY2015":{"allotted":17040,"spent":17003,"proposed":320}}},"funding_by_source":{"Equipment Lease (0302)":{"FY2010":{"allotted":4633,"spent":4633,"proposed":2500},"FY2011":{"allotted":7133,"spent":6342,"proposed":12500},"FY2012":{"allotted":15797,"spent":12620,"proposed":500},"FY2013":{"allotted":14629,"spent":12884,"proposed":0},"FY2014":{"allotted":16540,"spent":16222,"proposed":500},"FY2015":{"allotted":17040,"spent":17003,"proposed":320}}},"total_funding":{"FY2010":{"allotted":4633,"spent":4633,"proposed":2500},"FY2011":{"allotted":7133,"spent":6342,"proposed":12500},"FY2012":{"allotted":15797,"spent":12620,"proposed":500},"FY2013":{"allotted":14629,"spent":12884,"proposed":0},"FY2014":{"allotted":16540,"spent":16222,"proposed":500},"FY2015":{"allotted":17040,"spent":17003,"proposed":320}}}}
