This project allows OCTO to maintain a robust virtual server pool, which has the dual benefit of providing modern equipment to improve application performance, as well as decreasing the overall operating cost of the data centers due to a decrease in the need for physical servers. Virtual server pools can be defined as taking one physical server and making it appear as many servers on the network.","justification":"-","progress_assessment":"Ongoing project.","related_projects":"N2201C-SERVER CONSOLIDATION","milestones":{"environmental_approvals":{},"design_start":{},"design_complete":{},"construction_start":{},"construction_complete":{},"closeout":{}},"est_cost":1500000,"useful_life":10,"lat":null,"lon":null,"first_year":2014,"last_year":2015,"cip_history":{"FY2014":{"FY2014":1000,"FY2015":500,"FY2016":0,"FY2017":0,"FY2018":0,"FY2019":0},"FY2015":{"FY2015":500,"FY2016":0,"FY2017":0,"FY2018":0,"FY2019":0,"FY2020":0}},"cumulative_funding":{"funding_by_phase":{"(08) IT Deployment & Turnover":{"FY2014":{"allotted":0,"spent":0,"proposed":1000},"FY2015":{"allotted":1000,"spent":963,"proposed":500}}},"funding_by_source":{"GO Bonds - New (0300)":{"FY2014":{"allotted":0,"spent":0,"proposed":1000},"FY2015":{"allotted":1000,"spent":963,"proposed":500}}},"total_funding":{"FY2014":{"allotted":0,"spent":0,"proposed":1000},"FY2015":{"allotted":1000,"spent":963,"proposed":500}}}}
