{"active":false,"project_no":"EDL17","title":"DUPONT CROWN PARK INFRASTRUCTURE","agency":"DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION (KA0)","implementing_agency":"DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION (KA0)","ward":"2","location":"DUPONT CIRCLE","facility":"DUPONT CROWN PARK","status":"New","description":"The project will fund a bridge structure and green space over a sunken stretch of Connecticut Avenue north of Dupont Circle and south of Q Street NW.  It will serve as not only a park, but as an outdoor venue for restaurants, farmers markets, movies, music, plays and other artistic and cultural events.","justification":"Besides covering tunnel traffic with park space, this project would better connect the two sides of Connecticut Avenue, and add plenty of room to enjoy food from the eateries nearby. Further, since this would not be National Park Service (NPS) land, it would be possible to program this space with events much more flexibly than NPS regulations allow for the circle itself.  This park could also become the new site of the Dupont Circle farmers' market.","progress_assessment":"New project.","related_projects":"N/A","milestones":{"environmental_approvals":{},"design_start":{},"design_complete":{},"construction_start":{},"construction_complete":{},"closeout":{}},"est_cost":10000000,"lat":38.90963731,"lon":-77.04343937,"first_year":2015,"last_year":2015,"cip_history":{"FY2015":{"plan":{"FY2015":10000,"FY2016":0,"FY2017":0,"FY2018":0,"FY2019":0,"FY2020":0},"est_cost":10000000}},"cumulative_funding":{"funding_by_phase":{"(01) Design":{"FY2015":{"allotted":0,"spent":0,"proposed":10000}}},"funding_by_source":{"GO Bonds - New (0300)":{"FY2015":{"allotted":0,"spent":0,"proposed":10000}}},"total_funding":{"FY2015":{"allotted":0,"spent":0,"proposed":10000}}}}
