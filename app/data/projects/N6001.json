This initiative will provide design standards for a traffic management system, video surveillance, outdoor Wi-Fi hotspots, and IP-based environment sensors.  OCTO will devote specific resources that focus on bringing new technologies to the transportation cluster through a Deputy CTO, and a variety of projects that would serve the agencies in that cluster as well as intra-cluster benefits that may exist.","justification":"Improve traffic cameras, smart traffic signals, and smart meters through connectivity, this initiative will provide design standards for a traffic management system, video surveillance, outdoor Wi-Fi hotspots, and IP-based environmental sensors.","progress_assessment":"Ongoing project.","related_projects":"N6002C-TRANSPORTATION INFRASTRUCTURE MODERNIZATION","milestones":{"environmental_approvals":{},"design_start":{"projected":"10/01/12"},"design_complete":{},"construction_start":{},"construction_complete":{"projected":"09/30/20"},"closeout":{"projected":"12/31/21"}},"est_cost":1020000,"useful_life":5,"lat":null,"lon":null,"first_year":2013,"last_year":2015,"cip_history":{"FY2013":{"plan":{"FY2013":1000,"FY2014":0,"FY2015":500,"FY2016":0,"FY2017":0,"FY2018":0},"est_cost":1500000},"FY2014":{"plan":{"FY2014":0,"FY2015":500,"FY2016":0,"FY2017":0,"FY2018":0,"FY2019":0},"est_cost":1500000},"FY2015":{"plan":{"FY2015":500,"FY2016":0,"FY2017":0,"FY2018":0,"FY2019":0,"FY2020":0},"est_cost":1020000}},"cumulative_funding":{"funding_by_phase":{"(01) Design":{"FY2013":{"allotted":0,"spent":0,"proposed":1000},"FY2014":{"allotted":1000,"spent":0,"proposed":0},"FY2015":{"allotted":520,"spent":520,"proposed":500}}},"funding_by_source":{"Equipment Lease (0302)":{"FY2013":{"allotted":0,"spent":0,"proposed":1000},"FY2014":{"allotted":1000,"spent":0,"proposed":0},"FY2015":{"allotted":520,"spent":520,"proposed":500}}},"total_funding":{"FY2013":{"allotted":0,"spent":0,"proposed":1000},"FY2014":{"allotted":1000,"spent":0,"proposed":0},"FY2015":{"allotted":520,"spent":520,"proposed":500}}}}
