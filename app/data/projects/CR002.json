{"active":false,"project_no":"CR002","title":"RENOVATION OF CELL DOORS AND MOTORS","agency":"DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTIONS (FL0)","implementing_agency":"DEPARTMENT OF REAL ESTATE SERVICES (AM0)","ward":"6","location":"1901 D STREET SE","status":"In multiple phases","description":"Approximately 1,500 cell door and housing unit sallyport door mechanisms need to be redesigned and renovated along with their controls and wiring.  The electronic and mechanical systems  of the cell door operating mechanisms at the facility are over 30 years old.  The scope entails demolition of old cell-doors and the installation of all new cell-doors, their operating mechanisms, controls, and other appurtenances in all 18 cellblocks.","justification":"The electronic and mechanical systems of the cell door operating mechanisms at the facility are over 30 years old.  Accounting for the rough usage, the age of the cell doors and associated control systems is over 50 years.  They often break down and render the affected cell useless.  Inoperable and undependable cell doors present a major safety, security and health hazard at the facility.  This project must be completed ASAP because critical parts will not be available after FY2011, and this situation poses an imminent security and liability risk.","progress_assessment":"Project is progressing as planned.","related_projects":"none","milestones":{"environmental_approvals":{},"design_start":{"projected":"09/30/09","actual":"09/01/09"},"design_complete":{"projected":"06/01/10","actual":"02/15/10"},"construction_start":{"projected":"06/15/10"},"construction_complete":{"projected":"01/15/13"},"closeout":{"projected":"03/15/13"}},"useful_life":30,"facility":"CENTRAL DETENTION FACILITY","est_cost":23000000,"lat":38.88343091,"lon":-76.97637892,"first_year":2010,"last_year":2012,"cip_history":{"FY2010":{"plan":{"FY2010":3750,"FY2011":3582,"FY2012":2000,"FY2013":0,"FY2014":0,"FY2015":0},"est_cost":null},"FY2011":{"plan":{"FY2011":3582,"FY2012":2000,"FY2013":0,"FY2014":0,"FY2015":0,"FY2016":0},"est_cost":null},"FY2012":{"plan":{"FY2012":2000,"FY2013":0,"FY2014":0,"FY2015":0,"FY2016":0,"FY2017":0},"est_cost":23000000}},"cumulative_funding":{"funding_by_phase":{"(01) Design":{"FY2010":{"allotted":1027,"spent":877,"proposed":200},"FY2011":{"allotted":1267,"spent":1132,"proposed":300},"FY2012":{"allotted":1567,"spent":1459,"proposed":0}},"(03) Project Management":{"FY2010":{"allotted":309,"spent":298,"proposed":3550},"FY2011":{"allotted":501,"spent":301,"proposed":3282},"FY2012":{"allotted":583,"spent":376,"proposed":2000}},"(04) Construction":{"FY2010":{"allotted":400,"spent":114,"proposed":0},"FY2011":{"allotted":8318,"spent":7756,"proposed":0},"FY2012":{"allotted":15018,"spent":14755,"proposed":0}}},"funding_by_source":{"GO Bonds - New (0300)":{"FY2010":{"allotted":1736,"spent":1289,"proposed":3750},"FY2011":{"allotted":10086,"spent":9189,"proposed":3582},"FY2012":{"allotted":17168,"spent":16590,"proposed":2000}}},"total_funding":{"FY2010":{"allotted":1736,"spent":1289,"proposed":3750},"FY2011":{"allotted":10086,"spent":9189,"proposed":3582},"FY2012":{"allotted":17168,"spent":16590,"proposed":2000}}}}
