Specifically, upgrades to each locker room will include new personal duty lockers, plumbing fixtures, shower areas, and ventilation systems. The new finishes installed will be more durable and able to withstand this 24/7/365 environment.","justification":"All of MPD Patrol Districts and the officers that serve within these facilities operate on a 24/7/365 basis. The locker room facilities at most of the MPD Patrol Districts utilize lockers and plumbing fixtures that are beyond their useful product lifecycle.  In addition, the amount of equipment that the average patrol officer is required to store has increased significantly and can include CDU, STAT, and CHEM/BIO gear.","progress_assessment":"New project.","related_projects":"NA","milestones":{"environmental_approvals":{},"design_start":{},"design_complete":{},"construction_start":{},"construction_complete":{},"closeout":{}},"est_cost":3000000,"lat":null,"lon":null,"first_year":2015,"last_year":2015,"cip_history":{"FY2015":{"plan":{"FY2015":3000,"FY2016":0,"FY2017":0,"FY2018":0,"FY2019":0,"FY2020":0},"est_cost":3000000}},"cumulative_funding":{"funding_by_phase":{"(04) Construction":{"FY2015":{"allotted":0,"spent":0,"proposed":3000}}},"funding_by_source":{"GO Bonds - New (0300)":{"FY2015":{"allotted":0,"spent":0,"proposed":3000}}},"total_funding":{"FY2015":{"allotted":0,"spent":0,"proposed":3000}}}}
