They are coded and structured in such a way that all content is forced to appear on any device using the same page layout, making the page difficult to view or even unusable on devices with smaller screen sizes. As a result, web content pertaining to agencies such as MPDC, HSEMA and other public safety agencies is not readily available when residents use their tablets or mobile devices. The same is true with regard to transparency. Content the enables residents to obtain critical information on DC.Gov websites, FOIA information for example, is not so readily available other than when using a desktop computer.","progress_assessment":"New project.","related_projects":"N1709C and N3699C","milestones":{"environmental_approvals":{},"design_start":{"projected":"10/01/14"},"design_complete":{},"construction_start":{},"construction_complete":{},"closeout":{"projected":"09/30/18"}},"est_cost":1492000,"useful_life":5,"lat":null,"lon":null,"first_year":2015,"last_year":2015,"cip_history":{"FY2015":{"FY2015":1492,"FY2016":0,"FY2017":0,"FY2018":0,"FY2019":0,"FY2020":0}},"cumulative_funding":{"funding_by_phase":{"(06) IT Requirements Development/Systems Design":{"FY2015":{"allotted":0,"spent":0,"proposed":1492}}},"funding_by_source":{"GO Bonds - New (0300)":{"FY2015":{"allotted":0,"spent":0,"proposed":1492}}},"total_funding":{"FY2015":{"allotted":0,"spent":0,"proposed":1492}}}}
