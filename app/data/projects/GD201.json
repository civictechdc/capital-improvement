Originally, the intent was to consolidate workspace at McKinley Tech High School, but this option was not feasible. Currently the OSSE has employees located at five different locations: 441 4th St NW, 51 N St NE, Van Ness Elementary School, 5th & M St, SW, UDC at 8th street NW and 717 14th St, NW. The scope of work will include, but is not limited to, 1) development of architectural and engineering, 2) facility construction, 3) relocation and 4) completion and occupancy.","justification":"The OSSE was created in FY 2008 by combining departments within the State Education Office, District of Columbia Public Schools, Department of Human Services, Department of Health and the University of the District of Columbia. As a result, currently the OSSE has employees located at five different facility locations: 441 4th St NW, 51 N St NE, Van Ness Elementary School, 5th & M St, SW, UDC at 8th street NW and 717 14th St, NW. The consolidation of staff into one facility would immediately increase productivity due to a reduction in travel time for meetings from one facility to another as well as efficiencies gained from a reduction of duplication of services due to being located in multiple facilities.","progress_assessment":"Phase I of the project will relocate employees from 51 N street NE to 810 1st street, NE in August, 2009.","related_projects":"None.","milestones":{"environmental_approvals":{},"design_start":{},"design_complete":{},"construction_start":{"projected":"09/30/09"},"construction_complete":{"projected":"09/30/10"},"closeout":{}},"useful_life":30,"lat":38.90060547,"lon":-77.00702569,"first_year":2010,"last_year":2010,"cip_history":{"FY2010":{"plan":{"FY2010":2000,"FY2011":0,"FY2012":0,"FY2013":0,"FY2014":0,"FY2015":0},"est_cost":null}},"cumulative_funding":{"funding_by_phase":{"(04) Construction":{"FY2010":{"allotted":0,"spent":0,"proposed":2000}}},"funding_by_source":{"GO Bonds - New (0300)":{"FY2010":{"allotted":0,"spent":0,"proposed":2000}}},"total_funding":{"FY2010":{"allotted":0,"spent":0,"proposed":2000}}},"est_cost":2000000}
