This project improves sidewalks where there is deterioration or unsafe conditions and constructs sidewalks where there are missing segments.Annual work (construction) plans are established each year based on the available funding. A budget infusion for FY 2016 will help to address the backlog of projects.","justification":"This project maintains and constructs sidewalks on local streets.  Many of the sidewalks slated for construction are at locations that are unimproved (no sidewalks exist), are at locations that are safety hazards, or are at locations to address ADA standards and requirements.","progress_assessment":"DDOT develops an annual construction plan based on the approved budget.  This construction plan serves as the construction schedule.","related_projects":"Local sidewalks could be constructed within projects SR301-SR308 (local road resurfacing).  Sidewalks on federal-aid roads are reconstructed in streetscape reconstruction projects.  Sidewalks requiring minor repairs are also maintained with DDOT’s internal personnel, under project CE302.","milestones":{"environmental_approvals":{},"design_start":{},"design_complete":{},"construction_start":{},"construction_complete":{},"closeout":{}},"useful_life":10,"ward":"","facility":"LOCAL STREETS","est_cost":53385000,"lat":null,"lon":null,"first_year":2011,"last_year":2022,"cip_history":{"FY2011":{"FY2011":1750,"FY2012":1750,"FY2013":1750,"FY2014":1550,"FY2015":1550,"FY2016":1750},"FY2012":{"FY2012":1250,"FY2013":1350,"FY2014":1100,"FY2015":1100,"FY2016":1250,"FY2017":0},"FY2013":{"FY2013":1150,"FY2014":1100,"FY2015":1100,"FY2016":1250,"FY2017":0,"FY2018":1350},"FY2014":{"FY2014":2250,"FY2015":2475,"FY2016":2075,"FY2017":1926,"FY2018":2065,"FY2019":2065},"FY2015":{"FY2015":5475,"FY2016":2075,"FY2017":1926,"FY2018":2065,"FY2019":2065,"FY2020":2065},"FY2016":{"FY2016":5575,"FY2017":1926,"FY2018":2065,"FY2019":2065,"FY2020":2065,"FY2021":2065},"FY2017":{"FY2017":3250,"FY2018":3500,"FY2019":3500,"FY2020":4000,"FY2021":4000,"FY2022":4000}},"cumulative_funding":{"funding_by_phase":{"(01) Design":{"FY2011":{"allotted":11499,"spent":10971,"proposed":1750},"FY2012":{"allotted":14356,"spent":13610,"proposed":1250},"FY2013":{"allotted":15606,"spent":14942,"proposed":1150},"FY2014":{"allotted":16756,"spent":16569,"proposed":2250},"FY2015":{"allotted":19610,"spent":19466,"proposed":5475},"FY2016":{"allotted":25560,"spent":23635,"proposed":5575},"FY2017":{"allotted":31135,"spent":30291,"proposed":3250},"FY2018":{"allotted":34385,"spent":30291,"proposed":3500},"FY2019":{"allotted":37885,"spent":30291,"proposed":3500},"FY2020":{"allotted":41385,"spent":30291,"proposed":4000},"FY2021":{"allotted":45385,"spent":30291,"proposed":4000},"FY2022":{"allotted":49385,"spent":30291,"proposed":4000}},"(03) Project Management":{"FY2011":{"allotted":1519,"spent":1013,"proposed":1350},"FY2012":{"allotted":2634,"spent":2276,"proposed":114},"FY2013":{"allotted":2573,"spent":2382,"proposed":115},"FY2014":{"allotted":2688,"spent":2508,"proposed":250},"FY2015":{"allotted":2438,"spent":2351,"proposed":0},"FY2016":{"allotted":2350,"spent":2349,"proposed":505},"FY2017":{"allotted":2314,"spent":2311,"proposed":0},"FY2018":{"allotted":2314,"spent":2311,"proposed":0},"FY2019":{"allotted":2314,"spent":2311,"proposed":0},"FY2020":{"allotted":2314,"spent":2311,"proposed":0},"FY2021":{"allotted":2314,"spent":2311,"proposed":0},"FY2022":{"allotted":2314,"spent":2311,"proposed":0}},"(04) Construction":{"FY2011":{"allotted":9681,"spent":9659,"proposed":400},"FY2012":{"allotted":11215,"spent":10827,"proposed":1136},"FY2013":{"allotted":12526,"spent":12053,"proposed":1035},"FY2014":{"allotted":13561,"spent":13554,"proposed":2000},"FY2015":{"allotted":16665,"spent":16608,"proposed":5475},"FY2016":{"allotted":22703,"spent":20779,"proposed":5070},"FY2017":{"allotted":28314,"spent":27473,"proposed":3250},"FY2018":{"allotted":31564,"spent":27473,"proposed":3500},"FY2019":{"allotted":35064,"spent":27473,"proposed":3500},"FY2020":{"allotted":38564,"spent":27473,"proposed":4000},"FY2021":{"allotted":42564,"spent":27473,"proposed":4000},"FY2022":{"allotted":46564,"spent":27473,"proposed":4000}}},"funding_by_source":{"Local Street Main (0330)":{"FY2011":{"allotted":11499,"spent":11016,"proposed":1350}},"LRCMF PROJECTS -GO BOND FUNDING (0335)":{"FY2011":{"allotted":0,"spent":0,"proposed":400},"FY2012":{"allotted":400,"spent":175,"proposed":0},"FY2013":{"allotted":400,"spent":400,"proposed":0},"FY2014":{"allotted":400,"spent":400,"proposed":0},"FY2015":{"allotted":400,"spent":400,"proposed":0},"FY2016":{"allotted":400,"spent":400,"proposed":0},"FY2017":{"allotted":400,"spent":400,"proposed":0},"FY2018":{"allotted":400,"spent":400,"proposed":0},"FY2019":{"allotted":400,"spent":400,"proposed":0},"FY2020":{"allotted":400,"spent":400,"proposed":0},"FY2021":{"allotted":400,"spent":400,"proposed":0},"FY2022":{"allotted":400,"spent":400,"proposed":0}},"GO Bonds -
