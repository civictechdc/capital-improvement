{"active":true,"project_no":"CMSS1","title":"CASE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM - GO BOND","agency":"DEPARTMENT OF HUMAN SERVICES (JA0)","implementing_agency":"DEPARTMENT OF HUMAN SERVICES (JA0)","ward":"","location":"DISTRICT -WIDE","facility":"INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY","status":"Ongoing Subprojects","description":"The new project will marry the Health Insurance Exchange (HIX) and DC Consumer Access Reporting and Eligibility System (DC Cares). The HIX and DC CARES will enable District customers to use online and call center services to apply for and enroll in Medicaid, TANF, Food Stamps, and other federal and local health and human services programs. DHS and DHCF will be able to manage customersâ€™ multiple programs with the consolidated case management functionality that will also be implemented as part of this project.","justification":"Pursuant to the Affordable Care act of 2010 (ACA), the District is required to have a robust web-based eligibility system by October 1, 2013. Consequently, this project  will integrate the Health Insurance Exchange with the existing case management system, allowing District customers to use online and call center services to apply for and enroll in Medicaid, TANF, Food Stamps, and other federal and local health and human services programs. District citizens and families that find themselves in need of support or help are often the least able to help themselves negotiate the maze of agencies to find and enroll in the appropriate programs. They are often required to travel between several offices and provide a variety of documents to prove their eligibility for services. An integrated approach would allow a citizen to find out about the available District and federal resources available to them through a wide variety of programs and providers. Multiple agencies throughout the District serve the same families, children and adults, often at the same time through separately maintained systems and infrastructures.  This approach will simplify the process.","progress_assessment":"The project is progressing as planned.","related_projects":"CMSHS- Case Management System","milestones":{"environmental_approvals":{},"design_start":{"projected":"03/14/12"},"design_complete":{},"construction_start":{},"construction_complete":{"projected":"06/30/19"},"closeout":{"projected":"03/14/18"}},"est_cost":71856000,"useful_life":10,"lat":null,"lon":null,"first_year":2013,"last_year":2017,"cip_history":{"FY2013":{"FY2013":7325,"FY2014":5000,"FY2015":5000,"FY2016":837,"FY2017":0,"FY2018":0},"FY2014":{"FY2014":5000,"FY2015":5000,"FY2016":837,"FY2017":0,"FY2018":0,"FY2019":0},"FY2015":{"FY2015":15500,"FY2016":2837,"FY2017":0,"FY2018":0,"FY2019":0,"FY2020":0},"FY2016":{"FY2016":16157,"FY2017":23471,"FY2018":0,"FY2019":0,"FY2020":0,"FY2021":0},"FY2017":{"FY2017":23471,"FY2018":0,"FY2019":0,"FY2020":0,"FY2021":0,"FY2022":0}},"cumulative_funding":{"funding_by_phase":{"(01) Design":{"FY2013":{"allotted":0,"spent":0,"proposed":7325},"FY2014":{"allotted":7325,"spent":2867,"proposed":5000},"FY2015":{"allotted":12325,"spent":8278,"proposed":15500},"FY2016":{"allotted":32990,"spent":21130,"proposed":16157},"FY2017":{"allotted":48385,"spent":46345,"proposed":23471}},"(06) IT Requirements Development/Systems Design":{"FY2017":{"allotted":0,"spent":0,"proposed":23471}}},"funding_by_source":{"GO Bonds - New (0300)":{"FY2013":{"allotted":0,"spent":0,"proposed":7325},"FY2014":{"allotted":7325,"spent":2867,"proposed":5000},"FY2015":{"allotted":12325,"spent":8278,"proposed":15500},"FY2016":{"allotted":32990,"spent":21130,"proposed":16157},"FY2017":{"allotted":48385,"spent":46345,"proposed":23471}},"Pay Go (0301)":{"FY2013":{"allotted":0,"spent":0,"proposed":0}}},"total_funding":{"FY2013":{"allotted":0,"spent":0,"proposed":7325},"FY2014":{"allotted":7325,"spent":2867,"proposed":5000},"FY2015":{"allotted":12325,"spent":8278,"proposed":15500},"FY2016":{"allotted":32990,"spent":21130,"proposed":16157},"FY2017":{"allotted":48385,"spent":46345,"proposed":23471}}}}
