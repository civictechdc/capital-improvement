Schools need to have 100% wireless coverage in all teaching and administrative areas, and each classroom should have active network drops to support any device plugged into them (printers, PC's, interactive whiteboards, etc.).Seventy schools have or will be modernized by the 2014 - 2015 school year. Thirty - three more schools desperately need new routers, new switches, power upgrades, cabling work and new wireless Access Points (AP's) installed to be modernized by the 2-15 - 2016 school year. DC-Net analyzed all of the network equipment components and identified those components at the end of their useful life cycle, thus needing replacement. This aging equipment fails often, is costly to maintain, and gets in the way of establishing the wireless network needed by the Schools.","justification":"This project will upgrade information technology at DCPS facilities lacking modern technology infrastructure such as cabling and wiring, routers, switches, high speed internet connections, and other related improvements necessary for a fully functioning and technologically modern school.","progress_assessment":"The project is progressing as planned.","related_projects":"N8001C-DCPS IT Infrastructure Upgrade, DPR project NPR15C-IT Infrastructure-DPR, OCTO project N9101C-DC Government Citywide IT Security","milestones":{"environmental_approvals":{},"design_start":{},"design_complete":{},"construction_start":{},"construction_complete":{},"closeout":{}},"est_cost":32371000,"useful_life":10,"lat":null,"lon":null,"first_year":2014,"last_year":2022,"cip_history":{"FY2014":{"FY2014":4500,"FY2015":4500,"FY2016":0,"FY2017":0,"FY2018":0,"FY2019":0},"FY2015":{"FY2015":4500,"FY2016":0,"FY2017":0,"FY2018":0,"FY2019":0,"FY2020":0},"FY2016":{"FY2016":4000,"FY2017":4500,"FY2018":3000,"FY2019":4000,"FY2020":4500,"FY2021":1854},"FY2017":{"FY2017":4500,"FY2018":3000,"FY2019":4500,"FY2020":4500,"FY2021":1000,"FY2022":2000}},"cumulative_funding":{"funding_by_phase":{"(07) IT Development & Testing":{"FY2014":{"allotted":0,"spent":0,"proposed":4500},"FY2015":{"allotted":4500,"spent":3282,"proposed":4500},"FY2016":{"allotted":9000,"spent":8886,"proposed":4000}},"(07) IT Development Testing":{"FY2017":{"allotted":12871,"spent":12662,"proposed":4500},"FY2018":{"allotted":17371,"spent":12662,"proposed":3000},"FY2019":{"allotted":20371,"spent":12662,"proposed":4500},"FY2020":{"allotted":24871,"spent":12662,"proposed":4500},"FY2021":{"allotted":29371,"spent":12662,"proposed":1000},"FY2022":{"allotted":30371,"spent":12662,"proposed":2000}}},"funding_by_source":{"GO Bonds - New (0300)":{"FY2014":{"allotted":0,"spent":0,"proposed":4500},"FY2015":{"allotted":4500,"spent":3282,"proposed":4500},"FY2016":{"allotted":9000,"spent":8886,"proposed":4000},"FY2017":{"allotted":12871,"spent":12662,"proposed":4500},"FY2018":{"allotted":17371,"spent":12662,"proposed":3000},"FY2019":{"allotted":20371,"spent":12662,"proposed":4500},"FY2020":{"allotted":24871,"spent":12662,"proposed":4500},"FY2021":{"allotted":29371,"spent":12662,"proposed":1000},"FY2022":{"allotted":30371,"spent":12662,"proposed":2000}}},"total_funding":{"FY2014":{"allotted":0,"spent":0,"proposed":4500},"FY2015":{"allotted":4500,"spent":3282,"proposed":4500},"FY2016":{"allotted":9000,"spent":8886,"proposed":4000},"FY2017":{"allotted":12871,"spent":12662,"proposed":4500},"FY2018":{"allotted":17371,"spent":12662,"proposed":3000},"FY2019":{"allotted":20371,"spent":12662,"proposed":4500},"FY2020":{"allotted":24871,"spent":12662,"proposed":4500},"FY2021":{"allotted":29371,"spent":12662,"proposed":1000},"FY2022":{"allotted":30371,"spent":12662,"proposed":2000}}}}
