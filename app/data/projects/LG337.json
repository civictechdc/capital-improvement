Simulators will include remotely controlled, propane gas fired props to simulate automobile fires, gas meter fires, and flammable liquid spill fires securely mounted on a concrete pad with appropriate emergency shut off devices installed. The project will also include the construction of a fire extinguisher training area with a code compliant extinguishing agent containment/recycling system, a large concrete pad with appropriate props for safely conducting automobile extrication training, and a concrete simulation of a trench excavation to be used for cave-in/collapse rescue training.","justification":"This project is critical toward providing much needed training to our firefighters and EMS providers. The agency has been forced to contract with other state agencies to provide training due to the lack of available resources. This investment in training will show a positive correlation to the reduction of injuries on the fireground.","progress_assessment":"This is an ongoing project with different training props being purchased in different fiscal years.","related_projects":"LD839C, EVOC Course","milestones":{"environmental_approvals":{},"design_start":{},"design_complete":{},"construction_start":{},"construction_complete":{},"closeout":{}},"useful_life":8,"facility":"FIRE & EMS TRAINING ACADEMY","est_cost":3606000,"lat":38.82053486,"lon":-77.01608052,"first_year":2010,"last_year":2014,"cip_history":{"FY2010":{"plan":{"FY2010":0,"FY2011":1100,"FY2012":1100,"FY2013":1100,"FY2014":1100,"FY2015":0},"est_cost":null},"FY2011":{"plan":{"FY2011":270,"FY2012":1100,"FY2013":0,"FY2014":550,"FY2015":0,"FY2016":0},"est_cost":null},"FY2012":{"plan":{"FY2012":0,"FY2013":0,"FY2014":1650,"FY2015":0,"FY2016":0,"FY2017":0},"est_cost":1100000},"FY2013":{"plan":{"FY2013":0,"FY2014":1650,"FY2015":0,"FY2016":0,"FY2017":0,"FY2018":0},"est_cost":4000000},"FY2014":{"plan":{"FY2014":1650,"FY2015":0,"FY2016":0,"FY2017":0,"FY2018":0,"FY2019":0},"est_cost":3606000}},"cumulative_funding":{"funding_by_phase":{"(01) Design":{"FY2010":{"allotted":500,"spent":162,"proposed":0},"FY2011":{"allotted":306,"spent":163,"proposed":0},"FY2012":{"allotted":162,"spent":162,"proposed":0},"FY2013":{"allotted":162,"spent":162,"proposed":0},"FY2014":{"allotted":162,"spent":162,"proposed":0}},"(03) Project Management":{"FY2010":{"allotted":700,"spent":0,"proposed":0},"FY2011":{"allotted":700,"spent":460,"proposed":0},"FY2012":{"allotted":460,"spent":460,"proposed":0},"FY2013":{"allotted":460,"spent":460,"proposed":0},"FY2014":{"allotted":460,"spent":460,"proposed":0}},"(04) Construction":{"FY2010":{"allotted":1500,"spent":357,"proposed":0},"FY2011":{"allotted":1694,"spent":1680,"proposed":270},"FY2012":{"allotted":1333,"spent":1333,"proposed":0},"FY2013":{"allotted":1333,"spent":1285,"proposed":0},"FY2014":{"allotted":1333,"spent":1285,"proposed":1650}}},"funding_by_source":{"GO Bonds - New (0300)":{"FY2010":{"allotted":2700,"spent":520,"proposed":0},"FY2011":{"allotted":2700,"spent":2331,"proposed":270},"FY2012":{"allotted":1956,"spent":1956,"proposed":0},"FY2013":{"allotted":1956,"spent":1908,"proposed":0},"FY2014":{"allotted":1956,"spent":1908,"proposed":1650}}},"total_funding":{"FY2010":{"allotted":2700,"spent":519,"proposed":0},"FY2011":{"allotted":2700,"spent":2303,"proposed":270},"FY2012":{"allotted":1955,"spent":1955,"proposed":0},"FY2013":{"allotted":1955,"spent":1907,"proposed":0},"FY2014":{"allotted":1955,"spent":1907,"proposed":1650}}}}
