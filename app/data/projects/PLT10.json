Palantir was designed for environments where the fragments of data that an analyst combines to tell the larger story are spread across a vast set of starting material.  Palantir provides flexible tools to import and model data, intuitive constructs to search against this data, and powerful techniques to iteratively define and test hypotheses.","justification":"Today, MPD members must log into numerous individual systems and manually integrate the data to perform analysis.  This process is time-intensive, manual, and vulnerable to errors. Analytical products are not always completed within the desired timeframes. Palantir will enable timely data mining and analysis.","progress_assessment":"This is a new project.","related_projects":"There are no related projects.","milestones":{"environmental_approvals":{},"design_start":{"projected":"04/01/13"},"design_complete":{},"construction_start":{},"construction_complete":{},"closeout":{"projected":"09/30/14"}},"est_cost":6000000,"useful_life":5,"lat":null,"lon":null,"first_year":2014,"last_year":2017,"cip_history":{"FY2014":{"plan":{"FY2014":2500,"FY2015":0,"FY2016":0,"FY2017":0,"FY2018":0,"FY2019":0},"est_cost":2500000},"FY2017":{"plan":{"FY2017":3500,"FY2018":0,"FY2019":0,"FY2020":0,"FY2021":0,"FY2022":0},"est_cost":6000000}},"cumulative_funding":{"funding_by_phase":{"(06) IT Requirements Development/Systems Design":{"FY2014":{"allotted":0,"spent":0,"proposed":2500},"FY2017":{"allotted":2500,"spent":2500,"proposed":3500}}},"funding_by_source":{"GO Bonds - New (0300)":{"FY2014":{"allotted":0,"spent":0,"proposed":2500},"FY2017":{"allotted":2500,"spent":2500,"proposed":3500}}},"total_funding":{"FY2014":{"allotted":0,"spent":0,"proposed":2500},"FY2017":{"allotted":2500,"spent":2500,"proposed":3500}}}}
