The facility will meet the needs outlined in the five focus areas of library activity envisioned by DCPL, as follows:  service to children and teens; library as a community place; books and other library materials; technology; and adult literacy and learning. The project will also consist of providing between 3,500 to 5,000 square feet of interim/temporary/swing space in order to assure continued library services during construction activities. The Palisades Neighborhood Library will reflect the program and goals of the library and the needs of the District of Columbia residents that use it. The building will incorporate forward-thinking approaches to urban design, architecture, engineering and environmental technologies in the public realm. The PalisadesNeighborhood Library will be a destination that will attract and support hundreds of users per day, and promote a vibrant, mixed-use neighborhood and active street environment. The library will have an iconic architectural presence befitting its location in the community, yet be reflective of the city's modern growth and new innovations in building design and technology.","justification":"The existing building can be successfully rehabilitated in to a modern serviceable facility.","progress_assessment":"This is an on-going project.","related_projects":"N/A","milestones":{"environmental_approvals":{},"design_start":{"projected":"04/15/15"},"design_complete":{"projected":"04/16/16"},"construction_start":{"projected":"10/25/16"},"construction_complete":{"projected":"12/01/17"},"closeout":{"projected":"02/15/18"}},"est_cost":7192000,"useful_life":30,"lat":38.9183818,"lon":-77.09717464,"first_year":2012,"last_year":2016,"cip_history":{"FY2012":{"FY2012":0,"FY2013":0,"FY2014":0,"FY2015":0,"FY2016":0,"FY2017":2965},"FY2013":{"FY2013":0,"FY2014":0,"FY2015":0,"FY2016":0,"FY2017":2965,"FY2018":0},"FY2014":{"FY2014":0,"FY2015":11000,"FY2016":10700,"FY2017":0,"FY2018":0,"FY2019":0},"FY2015":{"FY2015":6700,"FY2016":15000,"FY2017":0,"FY2018":0,"FY2019":0,"FY2020":0},"FY2016":{"FY2016":1500,"FY2017":0,"FY2018":0,"FY2019":0,"FY2020":0,"FY2021":0}},"cumulative_funding":{"funding_by_phase":{"(01) Design":{"FY2012":{"allotted":0,"spent":0,"proposed":0},"FY2013":{"allotted":0,"spent":0,"proposed":0},"FY2016":{"allotted":5692,"spent":157,"proposed":1500}},"(02) SITE":{"FY2012":{"allotted":0,"spent":0,"proposed":0},"FY2013":{"allotted":0,"spent":0,"proposed":0},"FY2016":{"allotted":370,"spent":0,"proposed":0}},"(03) Project Management":{"FY2012":{"allotted":0,"spent":0,"proposed":0},"FY2013":{"allotted":0,"spent":0,"proposed":0},"FY2014":{"allotted":0,"spent":0,"proposed":0},"FY2016":{"allotted":1680,"spent":157,"proposed":92}},"(04) Construction":{"FY2015":{"allotted":0,"spent":0,"proposed":6700},"FY2016":{"allotted":2292,"spent":0,"proposed":1408}}},"funding_by_source":{"GO Bonds - New (0300)":{"FY2012":{"allotted":0,"spent":0,"proposed":0},"FY2013":{"allotted":0,"spent":0,"proposed":0},"FY2014":{"allotted":0,"spent":0,"proposed":0},"FY2015":{"allotted":0,"spent":0,"proposed":6700},"FY2016":{"allotted":5692,"spent":158,"proposed":1500}}},"total_funding":{"FY2012":{"allotted":0,"spent":0,"proposed":0},"FY2013":{"allotted":0,"spent":0,"proposed":0},"FY2016":{"allotted":5692,"spent":157,"proposed":1500},"FY2014":{"allotted":0,"spent":0,"proposed":0},"FY2015":{"allotted":0,"spent":0,"proposed":6700}}}}
