This network upgrade will also allow MPD direct radio introperability with all surrounding jurisdictions using 700 and 800 MHz frequencies. There will be more portable and mobile radio vendors supporting this common P-25 radio standard, affording greater flexibility and bargaining power to the District.  Enhanced features and capabilities will result in annual operational cost savings are more efficient single radio network.","justification":"MHz, managed under a single centralized master site controller facilitating inter-agency radio communications. This operational configuration is functional, but poses significant challenges for the District's first responders operational efficiency and interoperable communications. Additionally, operating two separate radio frequency ranges deters efficient cost investment on maintenance, infrastructure purchase, common radios, compatible equipment and other operational aspects. Without these upgrades, the overall emergency communications in the District will falter and result in a drop in service for the constituents of the District.","progress_assessment":"On-going","related_projects":"UC202C","milestones":{"environmental_approvals":{},"design_start":{"projected":"09/14/09","actual":"09/14/09"},"design_complete":{},"construction_start":{},"construction_complete":{},"closeout":{}},"useful_life":15,"facility":"P25 RADIO SYSTEM UPGRADE","est_cost":52500000,"lat":null,"lon":null,"first_year":2010,"last_year":2012,"cip_history":{"FY2010":{"FY2010":2500,"FY2011":5000,"FY2012":5000,"FY2013":5000,"FY2014":5000,"FY2015":2500},"FY2011":{"FY2011":5000,"FY2012":5000,"FY2013":5000,"FY2014":2500,"FY2015":0,"FY2016":0},"FY2012":{"FY2012":5902,"FY2013":0,"FY2014":0,"FY2015":0,"FY2016":0,"FY2017":0}},"cumulative_funding":{"funding_by_phase":{"(01) Design":{"FY2010":{"allotted":0,"spent":-350,"proposed":2500},"FY2011":{"allotted":2500,"spent":420,"proposed":5000},"FY2012":{"allotted":7500,"spent":7027,"proposed":5902}},"(03) Project Management":{"FY2010":{"allotted":0,"spent":0,"proposed":250},"FY2011":{"allotted":250,"spent":0,"proposed":0},"FY2012":{"allotted":250,"spent":250,"proposed":0}},"(05) Equipment":{"FY2010":{"allotted":0,"spent":0,"proposed":1750},"FY2011":{"allotted":1750,"spent":0,"proposed":5000},"FY2012":{"allotted":6750,"spent":6277,"proposed":5902}}},"funding_by_source":{"GO Bonds - New (0300)":{"FY2010":{"allotted":0,"spent":-350,"proposed":2500},"FY2011":{"allotted":2500,"spent":420,"proposed":5000},"FY2012":{"allotted":7500,"spent":7027,"proposed":5902}}},"total_funding":{"FY2010":{"allotted":0,"spent":-350,"proposed":2500},"FY2011":{"allotted":2500,"spent":420,"proposed":5000},"FY2012":{"allotted":7500,"spent":7027,"proposed":5902}}}}
