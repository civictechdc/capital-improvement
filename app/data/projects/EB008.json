The goal of the Initiative is to redevelop the neighborhoods into healthy, vibrant, mixed-use, mixed-income communities for current and future residents.  Phase I of the New Communities Implementation Strategy is estimated to result in the creation of approximately 3,500 mixed-income housing units, including an estimated 900 affordable replacement units, across all 4 New Communities. Each plan includes three parts: (1) Physical Strategy to guide implementation of the areaâ€™s physical redevelopment; (2) Financial Strategy to fund the redevelopment activities; and (3) Human Capital to provide existing residents with support services.","justification":"This project includes the comprehensive redevelopment of neighborhoods with high concentrations of low income housing and high rates of crimes.The projects replace low density single use housing with stable neighborhood anchors such as schools, community centers, neighborhood servicing retail to create sustainable safe mixed income mixed use community.","progress_assessment":"On an annual basis, the Office of the Deputy Mayor Office for Planning and Economic Development and the District of Columbia Housing Authority shall submit a written report to the Chairperson of the Committee on Economic Development for the District of Columbia, in accordance with the Fiscal Year 2014 Budget Support Act of 2013.","related_projects":"EB001C-TEMPLE COURTS/NW1 REDEVELOPMENT;
