The project funding will allow DPR to design and construct a series of dog parks throughout the District. Dog parks have opened at S Street NW; Shaw; and Walter Pierce Park. Three parks (Newark, Kingsman Field, and Upshur Park) will open by fall 2010.","justification":"The District is currently lacking in facilities able to accommodate off-leash dog play while still protecting the health, safety, and welfare of other visitors to the park. As more residents choose to own dogs in urban areas, recreational facilities should be provided to accommodate the needs of this user group. This increased demand by District residents has put a significant strain on the capacity to accommodate these needs; therefore, funding is critical. Funding additional off-leash dog parks would help achieve the following 2008 Performance Plan objectives outlined by DPR.","progress_assessment":"DPR has opened three dog parks and will open three more in FY 2010. More projects will be implemented as funding allows.","related_projects":"N/A","milestones":{"environmental_approvals":{},"design_start":{},"design_complete":{},"construction_start":{},"construction_complete":{},"closeout":{}},"useful_life":30,"facility":"OFF-LEASH DOG PARKS","lat":null,"lon":null,"first_year":2010,"last_year":2011,"cip_history":{"FY2010":{"FY2010":250,"FY2011":550,"FY2012":500,"FY2013":0,"FY2014":500,"FY2015":500},"FY2011":{"FY2011":287,"FY2012":500,"FY2013":0,"FY2014":250,"FY2015":0,"FY2016":0}},"cumulative_funding":{"funding_by_phase":{"(01) Design":{"FY2010":{"allotted":1200,"spent":1099,"proposed":250},"FY2011":{"allotted":1629,"spent":1309,"proposed":287}},"(04) Construction":{"FY2010":{"allotted":1000,"spent":999,"proposed":150},"FY2011":{"allotted":1150,"spent":1065,"proposed":237}},"(03) Project Management":{"FY2011":{"allotted":179,"spent":9,"proposed":0}}},"funding_by_source":{"GO Bonds - New (0300)":{"FY2010":{"allotted":1200,"spent":1099,"proposed":250},"FY2011":{"allotted":1629,"spent":1479,"proposed":287}}},"total_funding":{"FY2010":{"allotted":1200,"spent":1099,"proposed":250},"FY2011":{"allotted":1629,"spent":1309,"proposed":287}}},"est_cost":1916000}
