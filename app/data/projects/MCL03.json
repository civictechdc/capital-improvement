MEMORIAL CENTRAL LIBRARY","image":"fy15-83_1.jpg","agency":"DC PUBLIC LIBRARY (CE0)","implementing_agency":"DC PUBLIC LIBRARY (CE0)","ward":"2","location":"901 G STREET NW","facility":"MARTIN LUTHER KING JR. MEMORIAL CENTRAL LIBRARY","status":"Ongoing Subprojects","description":"The renovated Martin Luther King Jr. Memorial Central Library will reflect the program and goals of the Library and the needs of the District of Columbia residents who use the library. While being respectful of the only Mies van der Rohe building in the District, the building will incorporate forward-thinking approaches to urban design, architecture, engineering, and environmental technologies in the public realm. The renovated MLK Library will be a destination that will attract and support hundreds of users a day, and promote a vibrant, mixed-use neighborhood and active street environment. A building condition assessment was conducted in 2010 and  indicated numerous costly replacements  and upgrades were needed. The District continues to pay for ongoing maintenance issues. The building is not energy efficient.Strategic capital improvements have been completed and are currently planned, however, they do not come close to the amount of work that is needed to ensure that this is a thriving civic facility.  Based on the 2010 Building Condition Assessment the majority of the main building systems are beyond their useful life.    The expanded library facilities and subsequent expanded library programs fits into the mayorâ€™s educational priorities.","justification":"The project is necessary because the existing Martin Luther King Jr. Memorial Library building does not meet the District's needs as a central library. This project aligns with SustainableDC Action: Built Environment 3.5.","progress_assessment":"Project is ongoing.","related_projects":"None","milestones":{"environmental_approvals":{},"design_start":{"projected":"02/15/14"},"design_complete":{"projected":"05/17/16"},"construction_start":{"projected":"11/02/16"},"construction_complete":{"projected":"04/16/20"},"closeout":{"projected":"12/30/22"}},"useful_life":30,"est_cost":208557000,"lat":38.89869166,"lon":-77.02476625,"first_year":2011,"last_year":2020,"cip_history":{"FY2011":{"plan":{"FY2011":901,"FY2012":0,"FY2013":0,"FY2014":0,"FY2015":0,"FY2016":0},"est_cost":null},"FY2012":{"plan":{"FY2012":2900,"FY2013":1000,"FY2014":500,"FY2015":1000,"FY2016":500,"FY2017":1000},"est_cost":8120000},"FY2013":{"plan":{"FY2013":1000,"FY2014":0,"FY2015":0,"FY2016":0,"FY2017":0,"FY2018":0},"est_cost":6120000},"FY2014":{"plan":{"FY2014":3000,"FY2015":0,"FY2016":0,"FY2017":50000,"FY2018":50000,"FY2019":0},"est_cost":109000000},"FY2015":{"plan":{"FY2015":14500,"FY2016":0,"FY2017":4500,"FY2018":0,"FY2019":76500,"FY2020":113000},"est_cost":220000000},"FY2016":{"plan":{"FY2016":5600,"FY2017":41750,"FY2018":62000,"FY2019":57250,"FY2020":18000,"FY2021":0},"est_cost":208557000},"FY2017":{"plan":{"FY2017":41750,"FY2018":62000,"FY2019":57250,"FY2020":18000,"FY2021":0,"FY2022":0},"est_cost":208557000}},"cumulative_funding":{"funding_by_phase":{"(01) Design":{"FY2011":{"allotted":162,"spent":162,"proposed":901},"FY2012":{"allotted":1063,"spent":523,"proposed":0},"FY2013":{"allotted":1488,"spent":1212,"proposed":0},"FY2014":{"allotted":1488,"spent":1395,"proposed":0},"FY2015":{"allotted":4170,"spent":4170,"proposed":5000},"FY2016":{"allotted":13970,"spent":4372,"proposed":0},"FY2017":{"allotted":15710,"spent":13258,"proposed":91},"FY2018":{"allotted":15801,"spent":13258,"proposed":0},"FY2019":{"allotted":15801,"spent":13258,"proposed":0},"FY2020":{"allotted":15801,"spent":13258,"proposed":0}},"(03) Project Management":{"FY2011":{"allotted":157,"spent":157,"proposed":0},"FY2012":{"allotted":157,"spent":152,"proposed":0},"FY2013":{"allotted":732,"spent":398,"proposed":52},"FY2014":{"allotted":634,"spent":605,"proposed":0},"FY2015":{"allotted":1281,"spent":1250,"proposed":9500},"FY2016":{"allotted":5353,"spent":2030,"proposed":217},"FY2017":{"allotted":6270,"spent":3567,"proposed":319},"FY2018":{"allotted":6589,"spent":3567,"proposed":0},"FY2019":{"allotted":6589,"spent":3567,"proposed":0},"FY2020":{"allotted":6589,"spent":3567,"proposed":0}},"(04) Construction":{"FY2012":{"allotted":0,"spent":0,"proposed":2900},"FY2013":{"allotted":2800,"spent":90,"proposed":948},"FY2014":{"allotted":3748,"spent":3578,"proposed":3000},"FY2015":{"allotted":3933,"spent":3915,"proposed":0},"FY2016":{"allotted":4561,"spent":3929,"proposed":5383},"FY2017":{"allotted":7504,"spent":2223,"proposed":41340},"FY2018":{"allotted":48844,"spent":2223,"proposed":62000},"FY2019":{"allotted":110844,"spent":2223,"proposed":57250},"FY2020":{"allotted":168094,"spent":2223,"proposed":18000}},"(02) SITE":{"FY2013":{"allotted":100,"spent":48,"proposed":0},"FY2014":{"allotted":100,"spent":48,"proposed":0},"FY2015":{"allotted":48,"spent":48,"proposed":0},"FY2016":{"allotted":48,"spent":48,"proposed":0},"FY2017":{"allotted":48,"spent":48,"proposed":0},"FY2018":{"allotted":48,"spent":48,"proposed":0},"FY2019":{"allotted":48,"spent":48,"proposed":0},"FY2020":{"allotted":48,"spent":48,"proposed":0}},"(05) Equipment":{"FY2014":{"allotted":150,"spent":147,"proposed":0},"FY2015":{"allotted":25,"spent":-1,"proposed":0},"FY2016":{"allotted":25,"spent":7,"proposed":0},"FY2017":{"allotted":25,"spent":7,"proposed":0},"FY2018":{"allotted":25,"spent":7,"proposed":0},"FY2019":{"allotted":25,"spent":7,"proposed":0},"FY2020":{"allotted":25,"spent":7,"proposed":0}}},"funding_by_source":{"GO Bonds -
