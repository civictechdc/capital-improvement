{"active":true,"project_no":"CSP08","title":"INTEGRATED TAX SYSTEM MODERNIZATION","image":"fy10-54_1.jpg","agency":"OFFICE OF THE CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER (AT0)","implementing_agency":"OFFICE OF THE CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER (AT0)","ward":"","location":"DISTRICT-WIDE","status":"Ongoing Subprojects","description":"This project will completely modernize and refine the District’s tax systems to bring them in line with industry best practices and add new functionality in the areas of compliance, collections, case management,   individual, business and property tax collection; and processing and accounting. The tax system modernization will be achieved in stages to replace individual components starting with the case management module, real property system, and eventually the core tax management system.This project represents a modernization of the Integrated Tax System (ITS). The current system will require a technology refresh, particularly on the reporting and middle-ware tools, to take advantage of web-based technologies that were not available when the system was installed. This will require replacement of the SAND and the Crystal server-based systems currently in use for report and query building as well as supporting platform software and related applications. This investment will allow the core underlying system to remain in place, while simplifying maintenance requirements and allowing for further consolidation of servers and reduced bandwidth requirements.","justification":"The first phase is to replace the real property tax module, to address and reduce the risk of fraud and mismanagement by leveraging superior internal controls and industry best practices implemented in the replacement system.  In addition, the new case management system will provide intelligent case analytics; and review and analysis abilities that will result in increased tax compliance and collections, further resulting in increased revenues.The implementation of the Phase 1 will result in the capture of new tax revenue that will be recognized as Paygo transfers from the general fund to the capital fund in the amount of $6.0 million in FY2010.  This capital budget will help to offset the project costs.","progress_assessment":"The project is currently in the planning phase and high-level designs of all the different projects within the modernization initiative are being developed.  The District’s project manager for this effort has been hired.  Currently, requirements are being collected for the case management and real property tax system modules.","related_projects":"ELC CSP09 - ITS Modernization - Master Lease","milestones":{"environmental_approvals":{},"design_start":{"projected":"01/01/09"},"design_complete":{"projected":"01/01/10","actual":"06/01/10"},"construction_start":{"projected":"06/01/10"},"construction_complete":{"projected":"07/30/19"},"closeout":{"projected":"07/30/19"}},"useful_life":10,"facility":"INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY","est_cost":65420000,"lat":null,"lon":null,"first_year":2010,"last_year":2018,"cip_history":{"FY2010":{"plan":{"FY2010":3000,"FY2011":2000,"FY2012":0,"FY2013":0,"FY2014":0,"FY2015":0},"est_cost":null},"FY2011":{"plan":{"FY2011":2000,"FY2012":2000,"FY2013":600,"FY2014":0,"FY2015":0,"FY2016":0},"est_cost":null},"FY2012":{"plan":{"FY2012":3000,"FY2013":12600,"FY2014":6000,"FY2015":5500,"FY2016":3000,"FY2017":0},"est_cost":10000000},"FY2013":{"plan":{"FY2013":12420,"FY2014":6000,"FY2015":5500,"FY2016":3000,"FY2017":0,"FY2018":0},"est_cost":34920000},"FY2014":{"plan":{"FY2014":6000,"FY2015":5500,"FY2016":3000,"FY2017":0,"FY2018":10000,"FY2019":10000},"est_cost":54920000},"FY2015":{"plan":{"FY2015":5500,"FY2016":14000,"FY2017":11000,"FY2018":6000,"FY2019":0,"FY2020":0},"est_cost":62920000},"FY2016":{"plan":{"FY2016":14000,"FY2017":11000,"FY2018":6000,"FY2019":0,"FY2020":0,"FY2021":0},"est_cost":65420000},"FY2017":{"plan":{"FY2017":11000,"FY2018":6000,"FY2019":0,"FY2020":0,"FY2021":0,"FY2022":0},"est_cost":65420000}},"cumulative_funding":{"funding_by_phase":{"(06) IT Requirements Development/Systems Design":{"FY2010":{"allotted":0,"spent":0,"proposed":3000},"FY2011":{"allotted":3000,"spent":543,"proposed":2000},"FY2012":{"allotted":5000,"spent":543,"proposed":3000},"FY2013":{"allotted":8000,"spent":1725,"proposed":12420},"FY2014":{"allotted":20420,"spent":1848,"proposed":6000},"FY2015":{"allotted":26420,"spent":1702,"proposed":5500},"FY2016":{"allotted":34420,"spent":16213,"proposed":14000},"FY2017":{"allotted":48420,"spent":26489,"proposed":11000},"FY2018":{"allotted":59420,"spent":26489,"proposed":6000}}},"funding_by_source":{"GO Bonds - New (0300)":{"FY2010":{"allotted":0,"spent":0,"proposed":3000},"FY2011":{"allotted":3000,"spent":543,"proposed":2000},"FY2012":{"allotted":5000,"spent":543,"proposed":3000},"FY2013":{"allotted":8000,"spent":1725,"proposed":12420},"FY2014":{"allotted":20420,"spent":1848,"proposed":3433},"FY2015":{"allotted":23853,"spent":1702,"proposed":1500},"FY2016":{"allotted":34420,"spent":16213,"proposed":14000},"FY2017":{"allotted":48420,"spent":26489,"proposed":5000},"FY2018":{"allotted":53420,"spent":26489,"proposed":0}},"Pay Go (0301)":{"FY2012":{"allotted":0,"spent":0,"proposed":0},"FY2013":{"allotted":0,"spent":0,"proposed":0},"FY2014":{"allotted":0,"spent":0,"proposed":2567},"FY2015":{"allotted":2567,"spent":0,"proposed":4000},"FY2016":{"allotted":0,"spent":0,"proposed":0},"FY2017":{"allotted":0,"spent":0,"proposed":6000},"FY2018":{"allotted":6000,"spent":0,"proposed":6000}}},"total_funding":{"FY2010":{"allotted":0,"spent":0,"proposed":3000},"FY2011":{"allotted":3000,"spent":543,"proposed":2000},"FY2012":{"allotted":5000,"spent":543,"proposed":3000},"FY2013":{"allotted":8000,"spent":1725,"proposed":12420},"FY2014":{"allotted":20420,"spent":1848,"proposed":6000},"FY2015":{"allotted":26420,"spent":1702,"proposed":5500},"FY2016":{"allotted":34420,"spent":16213,"proposed":14000},"FY2017":{"allotted":48420,"spent":26489,"proposed":11000},"FY2018":{"allotted":59420,"spent":26489,"proposed":6000}}}}
