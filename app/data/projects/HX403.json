As a recovery-based system, affordable housing is one of the most effective supports to assist consumers in exercising personal choices, greater self-determination, and empowerment to change their own lives.  Funds will be used for housing development for consumers with serious and persistent mental illness. This request will continue the annual development of 100 units of affordable housing for very low-income to extremely low-income mentally ill residents of the District over a 6-year period; and provide favorable loan underwriting criteria and finance contingency planning.","justification":"The Department of Mental Health takes the position that in a recovery-based system, affordable housing is one of the most effective supports to assist consumers in exercising personal choices, greater self-determination, and empowerment to improve their own lives.  The District will benefit from reduced reliance on institutionalizing the mentally ill, and from the savings realized in returning its consumers to normal living standards.","progress_assessment":"After a three-year hiatus, this court-ordered project is progressing as planned.  The only challenge the project faces will be that of ensuring continued funding.","related_projects":"N/A","milestones":{"environmental_approvals":{},"design_start":{},"design_complete":{"projected":"05/02/04"},"construction_start":{"projected":"10/01/07"},"construction_complete":{"projected":"09/30/18"},"closeout":{"projected":"09/30/19"}},"useful_life":15,"ward":"","facility":"AFFORDABLE HOUSING","est_cost":68638000,"lat":null,"lon":null,"first_year":2010,"last_year":2014,"cip_history":{"FY2010":{"FY2010":446,"FY2011":0,"FY2012":0,"FY2013":0,"FY2014":0,"FY2015":0},"FY2013":{"FY2013":5000,"FY2014":5000,"FY2015":0,"FY2016":0,"FY2017":0,"FY2018":0},"FY2014":{"FY2014":5000,"FY2015":5000,"FY2016":5000,"FY2017":5000,"FY2018":0,"FY2019":0}},"cumulative_funding":{"funding_by_phase":{"(02) SITE":{"FY2010":{"allotted":40055,"spent":40055,"proposed":446},"FY2013":{"allotted":41501,"spent":40138,"proposed":5000},"FY2014":{"allotted":48638,"spent":44264,"proposed":5000}},"(03) Project Management":{"FY2010":{"allotted":14990,"spent":14990,"proposed":0},"FY2013":{"allotted":14990,"spent":14990,"proposed":0},"FY2014":{"allotted":14990,"spent":14990,"proposed":0}},"(04) Construction":{"FY2010":{"allotted":14066,"spent":14066,"proposed":446},"FY2013":{"allotted":15512,"spent":14149,"proposed":5000},"FY2014":{"allotted":22649,"spent":18275,"proposed":5000}}},"funding_by_source":{"GO Bonds - New (0300)":{"FY2010":{"allotted":40055,"spent":40055,"proposed":446},"FY2013":{"allotted":40501,"spent":40138,"proposed":5000},"FY2014":{"allotted":47638,"spent":43264,"proposed":5000}},"Pay Go (0301)":{"FY2013":{"allotted":1000,"spent":0,"proposed":0},"FY2014":{"allotted":1000,"spent":1000,"proposed":0}}},"total_funding":{"FY2010":{"allotted":40055,"spent":40055,"proposed":446},"FY2013":{"allotted":41501,"spent":40138,"proposed":5000},"FY2014":{"allotted":48638,"spent":44264,"proposed":5000}}}}
