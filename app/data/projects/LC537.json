The most important improvements will be the new Life Safety features by the installation of a fire sprinkler and fire alarm system.  The interior of this historic building will be redesigned and all of the buildingâ€™s electrical, lighting systems and plumbing will be replaced to the Silver level of the LEED standard for renovations.  The storm water management system will be replaced.  Working with the Historic Preservation Office, FEMS will widen the apparatus bay door to accomodate the larger apparatus FEMS will be required to purchase to meet the 2010 EPA Clean Emissions Standard.  All windows will be replaced with energy efficient windows that match the original ones.  A temporary fire station will provide uninterrupted protection to the community during this project.","justification":"Originally built in 1910, Engine 23 has not had a major renovation in over 28 years and the infrastructure of this station has long passed its useful life expectancy.  It has only had minor improvements or upgrades since it was constructed in 1910 and none since 1984. It does not comply with current basic standards such as ADA access, NFPA standards for Fire Stations, and female firefighter locker room accommodations.  All of the major systems are in poor condition and are beginning to fail. Renovating this station to modern LEED standards will result in an operating cost savings while preserving this historic landmark. This project aligns with SustainableDC Action: Built Environment 3.5.","progress_assessment":"New project.","related_projects":"None.","milestones":{"environmental_approvals":{},"design_start":{"projected":"04/01/09","actual":"04/01/09"},"design_complete":{"projected":"06/01/11"},"construction_start":{"projected":"01/01/12"},"construction_complete":{"projected":"01/01/20"},"closeout":{"projected":"02/01/21"}},"useful_life":30,"facility":"ENGINE 23","est_cost":7500000,"lat":38.89858288,"lon":-77.04762479,"first_year":2010,"last_year":2020,"cip_history":{"FY2010":{"FY2010":0,"FY2011":1200,"FY2012":1200,"FY2013":0,"FY2014":0,"FY2015":0},"FY2011":{"FY2011":1200,"FY2012":0,"FY2013":0,"FY2014":0,"FY2015":0,"FY2016":1200},"FY2013":{"FY2013":368,"FY2014":3000,"FY2015":0,"FY2016":0,"FY2017":0,"FY2018":0},"FY2014":{"FY2014":3000,"FY2015":0,"FY2016":0,"FY2017":0,"FY2018":0,"FY2019":0},"FY2015":{"FY2015":0,"FY2016":0,"FY2017":0,"FY2018":0,"FY2019":3750,"FY2020":3750},"FY2016":{"FY2016":0,"FY2017":0,"FY2018":0,"FY2019":3750,"FY2020":3750,"FY2021":0},"FY2017":{"FY2017":0,"FY2018":0,"FY2019":3750,"FY2020":3750,"FY2021":0,"FY2022":0}},"cumulative_funding":{"funding_by_phase":{"(01) Design":{"FY2010":{"allotted":300,"spent":300,"proposed":0},"FY2011":{"allotted":300,"spent":300,"proposed":1200},"FY2013":{"allotted":833,"spent":0,"proposed":368},"FY2014":{"allotted":1201,"spent":0,"proposed":3000},"FY2015":{"allotted":113,"spent":0,"proposed":0}},"(03) Project Management":{"FY2010":{"allotted":0,"spent":0,"proposed":0},"FY2011":{"allotted":0,"spent":0,"proposed":200}},"(04) Construction":{"FY2010":{"allotted":0,"spent":0,"proposed":0},"FY2011":{"allotted":0,"spent":0,"proposed":1000},"FY2013":{"allotted":718,"spent":0,"proposed":368},"FY2014":{"allotted":1086,"spent":0,"proposed":2887},"FY2015":{"allotted":0,"spent":0,"proposed":0},"FY2016":{"allotted":0,"spent":0,"proposed":0},"FY2017":{"allotted":0,"spent":0,"proposed":0},"FY2018":{"allotted":0,"spent":0,"proposed":0},"FY2019":{"allotted":0,"spent":0,"proposed":3750},"FY2020":{"allotted":3750,"spent":0,"proposed":3750}}},"funding_by_source":{"GO Bonds - New (0300)":{"FY2010":{"allotted":300,"spent":300,"proposed":0},"FY2011":{"allotted":300,"spent":300,"proposed":1200},"FY2013":{"allotted":833,"spent":0,"proposed":368},"FY2014":{"allotted":1201,"spent":0,"proposed":3000},"FY2015":{"allotted":113,"spent":0,"proposed":0},"FY2016":{"allotted":0,"spent":0,"proposed":0},"FY2017":{"allotted":0,"spent":0,"proposed":0},"FY2018":{"allotted":0,"spent":0,"proposed":0},"FY2019":{"allotted":0,"spent":0,"proposed":3750},"FY2020":{"allotted":3750,"spent":0,"proposed":3750}}},"total_funding":{"FY2010":{"allotted":300,"spent":300,"proposed":0},"FY2011":{"allotted":300,"spent":300,"proposed":1200},"FY2013":{"allotted":833,"spent":0,"proposed":368},"FY2014":{"allotted":1201,"spent":0,"proposed":3000},"FY2015":{"allotted":113,"spent":0,"proposed":0},"FY2016":{"allotted":0,"spent":0,"proposed":0},"FY2017":{"allotted":0,"spent":0,"proposed":0},"FY2018":{"allotted":0,"spent":0,"proposed":0},"FY2019":{"allotted":0,"spent":0,"proposed":3750},"FY2020":{"allotted":3750,"spent":0,"proposed":3750}}}}
