{"active":false,"project_no":"EQ101","title":"CREDENTIALING AND WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS","agency":"OFFICE OF CHIEF TECHNOLOGY OFFICER (TO0)","implementing_agency":"EQUIPMENT LEASE - CAPITAL (ELC)","location":"DISTRICT-WIDE","status":"Ongoing Subprojects","description":"This project includes design and construction of wireless infrastructure in various forms, from broadband wireless connectivity for District workers, residents and visitors to the enhancement of mobile computing and wireless enabled applications. This project will also enhance the development the DC One Card and the research and development of wireless devices (chips).  Other design, development and deployment of wireless infrastructure included in this project includes WIFI and other wireless technologies to provide Internet access to underserved populations in order to bridge the digital divide; and point-to-point, point-to-multipoint and mobile wireless connectivity to support public safety and other District government users.","justification":"This project (including its various subprojects) is necessary because, (1) by deploying publicly accessible wireless mobile computing technology OCTO can help bridge the digital divide in the District (2) by deploying wireless connectivity for first responders and other District government users, OCTO can increase public safety by providing mobile wireless broadband and computing service that is more reliable and secure than those offered by commercial carriers. (3) by consolidating credentials citywide, the District will be able to reduce the resources it uses for card production and management, thus saving money government-wide.  This will also provide substantial convenience to residents and easier access to government services.","progress_assessment":"This project is progressing as planned.","related_projects":"Though not necessarily connected to this project, any project that relies on or could benefit from use of a card (usually for ease of counting service usage) can be related to the DC One Card initiative.  In addition, projects focused on bridging the digital divide may be related to this project because the many aspects of the digital divide are connected to each other, including awareness, training, hardware, content, and Internet accessâ€”which may be provided under this project.  Finally, public safety mobile data sharing, emergency response, and situational awareness projects may be related to this project to the extent they would benefit from public-safety-grade mobile wireless connectivity.","milestones":{"environmental_approvals":{},"design_start":{"projected":"01/01/08"},"design_complete":{"projected":"06/30/13","actual":"06/30/13"},"construction_start":{"projected":"01/01/08","actual":"01/01/08"},"construction_complete":{"projected":"09/30/20"},"closeout":{"projected":"09/30/20"}},"useful_life":5,"facility":"INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY","ward":"","est_cost":12876000,"lat":null,"lon":null,"first_year":2010,"last_year":2015,"cip_history":{"FY2010":{"FY2010":0,"FY2011":0,"FY2012":3500,"FY2013":500,"FY2014":0,"FY2015":0},"FY2011":{"FY2011":1865,"FY2012":1000,"FY2013":500,"FY2014":0,"FY2015":0,"FY2016":0},"FY2012":{"FY2012":1000,"FY2013":500,"FY2014":0,"FY2015":0,"FY2016":0,"FY2017":2000},"FY2013":{"FY2013":0,"FY2014":0,"FY2015":0,"FY2016":0,"FY2017":2000,"FY2018":1000},"FY2014":{"FY2014":500,"FY2015":500,"FY2016":0,"FY2017":0,"FY2018":0,"FY2019":0},"FY2015":{"FY2015":500,"FY2016":0,"FY2017":0,"FY2018":0,"FY2019":0,"FY2020":0}},"cumulative_funding":{"funding_by_phase":{"(05) Equipment":{"FY2010":{"allotted":13849,"spent":10224,"proposed":0},"FY2011":{"allotted":11984,"spent":10446,"proposed":1865},"FY2012":{"allotted":11949,"spent":9954,"proposed":1000},"FY2013":{"allotted":11226,"spent":10096,"proposed":0},"FY2014":{"allotted":11876,"spent":10945,"proposed":500},"FY2015":{"allotted":12376,"spent":11883,"proposed":500}},"(06) IT Requirements Development/Systems Design":{"FY2010":{"allotted":500,"spent":52,"proposed":0},"FY2011":{"allotted":500,"spent":282,"proposed":0},"FY2012":{"allotted":500,"spent":316,"proposed":0},"FY2013":{"allotted":500,"spent":259,"proposed":0},"FY2014":{"allotted":500,"spent":259,"proposed":0},"FY2015":{"allotted":500,"spent":376,"proposed":0}}},"funding_by_source":{"Equipment Lease (0302)":{"FY2010":{"allotted":13849,"spent":10224,"proposed":0},"FY2011":{"allotted":11984,"spent":10445,"proposed":1865},"FY2012":{"allotted":11949,"spent":9954,"proposed":1000},"FY2013":{"allotted":11226,"spent":10096,"proposed":0},"FY2014":{"allotted":11876,"spent":10945,"proposed":500},"FY2015":{"allotted":12376,"spent":11883,"proposed":500}}},"total_funding":{"FY2010":{"allotted":13849,"spent":10224,"proposed":0},"FY2011":{"allotted":11984,"spent":10446,"proposed":1865},"FY2012":{"allotted":11949,"spent":9954,"proposed":1000},"FY2013":{"allotted":11226,"spent":10096,"proposed":0},"FY2014":{"allotted":11876,"spent":10945,"proposed":500},"FY2015":{"allotted":12376,"spent":11883,"proposed":500}}}}
