Spanning the Anacostia River, the park would link Historic Anacostia with the Navy Yard. Preliminary plans include bike and pedestrian trails, outdoor performance spaces, play areas, gardens, information about the river and its ecosystem, a dock to launch boats and kayaks to explore the river.No funds allocated for the purpose of the 11th Street Bridge Park project may be awarded or disbursed to any entity for purposes of construction until at least 50 percent of the total projected construction costs of the project have been raised from private donors.  No District funds may be awarded or expended for the purpose of operations or maintenance of the 11th Street Bridge Park.","justification":"A large, diverse group of stakeholders, led by THEARC in Ward 8 and with the assistance of DDOT, has been working to develop plans for this park.They expect to raise 50% of the $25 million projected cost for construction from privatedonors.","progress_assessment":"This is an on-going project.","related_projects":"N/A","milestones":{"environmental_approvals":{},"design_start":{"projected":"10/01/14"},"design_complete":{"projected":"09/30/15"},"construction_start":{"projected":"10/01/15"},"construction_complete":{"projected":"09/30/21"},"closeout":{"projected":"09/30/21"}},"est_cost":29450000,"useful_life":30,"lat":null,"lon":null,"first_year":2015,"last_year":2020,"cip_history":{"FY2015":{"FY2015":3100,"FY2016":12500,"FY2017":12500,"FY2018":0,"FY2019":0,"FY2020":0},"FY2016":{"FY2016":1350,"FY2017":0,"FY2018":0,"FY2019":5000,"FY2020":0,"FY2021":0},"FY2017":{"FY2017":0,"FY2018":0,"FY2019":0,"FY2020":8000,"FY2021":0,"FY2022":0}},"cumulative_funding":{"funding_by_phase":{"(01) Design":{"FY2015":{"allotted":0,"spent":0,"proposed":3100},"FY2016":{"allotted":3100,"spent":0,"proposed":1350},"FY2017":{"allotted":4450,"spent":0,"proposed":0},"FY2018":{"allotted":4450,"spent":0,"proposed":0},"FY2019":{"allotted":4450,"spent":0,"proposed":0},"FY2020":{"allotted":4450,"spent":0,"proposed":8000}},"(04) Construction":{"FY2016":{"allotted":0,"spent":0,"proposed":1350}},"(00) Feasibility Studies":{"FY2017":{"allotted":350,"spent":0,"proposed":0},"FY2018":{"allotted":350,"spent":0,"proposed":0},"FY2019":{"allotted":350,"spent":0,"proposed":0},"FY2020":{"allotted":350,"spent":0,"proposed":0}}},"funding_by_source":{"GO Bonds - New (0300)":{"FY2015":{"allotted":0,"spent":0,"proposed":2000},"FY2016":{"allotted":2000,"spent":0,"proposed":0},"FY2017":{"allotted":2000,"spent":0,"proposed":0},"FY2018":{"allotted":2000,"spent":0,"proposed":0},"FY2019":{"allotted":2000,"spent":0,"proposed":0},"FY2020":{"allotted":2000,"spent":0,"proposed":8000}},"Capital Fund - Federal Contribut (0345)":{"FY2015":{"allotted":0,"spent":0,"proposed":1100},"FY2016":{"allotted":1100,"spent":0,"proposed":0}},"Local Transportation Revenue (0330)":{"FY2016":{"allotted":0,"spent":0,"proposed":1350}},"Local Trans.
