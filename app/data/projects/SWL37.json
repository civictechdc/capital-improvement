The scope of work entails providing architectural and engineering services which comprises predesign, design, preparation of contract documents, commissioning, and planning services to fully or substantially comply with ADA Accessibility Guidelines for Buildings and Facilities; and to include vertical transportation, interior circulation, signage, entrances and exists, walkways, restrooms, alarms, etc. The Southwest Neighborhood Library will reflect the program and goals of the library and the needs of the District of Columbia residents who use it. The building will incorporate forward-thinking approaches to urban design, architecture, engineering, and environmental technologies in the public realm. The Southwest Library will be a destination that will attract and support hundreds of users per day, and promote a vibrant, mixed-use neighborhood and active street environment. A building condition assessment was conducted in 2001 and an additional building assessment was completed in December 2009. The 2001 report indicated numerous costly repairs and upgrades; this work has never been done in its entirety. The District continues to pay for ongoing maintenance issues. The building energy is inefficient.","justification":"The building is approximately 45 years old. The existing CMU masonry construction has limited flexibility to change within the existing walls of the building. As library use has changed over the years the need for electronic resources has expanded. However, expending the technology within the Southwest Library has proven extremely difficult.  The citizens living in Ward 6 will benefit from expanded library services much in the same way citizens in Wards 7 and 2 have benefited from their recently opened new libraries. The expanded library facilities and subsequent expanded library programs fits into the mayorâ€™s educational priorities. This project aligns with Sustainable DC Action: Built Environment 3.5.","progress_assessment":"This is a new project.","related_projects":"-","milestones":{"environmental_approvals":{},"design_start":{"projected":"10/01/16"},"design_complete":{"projected":"09/30/17"},"construction_start":{"projected":"01/02/18"},"construction_complete":{"projected":"06/15/20"},"closeout":{"projected":"08/15/20"}},"est_cost":18000000,"useful_life":30,"lat":38.87869795,"lon":-77.01583178,"first_year":2012,"last_year":2019,"cip_history":{"FY2012":{"plan":{"FY2012":0,"FY2013":0,"FY2014":0,"FY2015":0,"FY2016":0,"FY2017":3150},"est_cost":8857400},"FY2013":{"plan":{"FY2013":0,"FY2014":0,"FY2015":0,"FY2016":0,"FY2017":3150,"FY2018":10520},"est_cost":13670000},"FY2014":{"plan":{"FY2014":0,"FY2015":2000,"FY2016":14000,"FY2017":0,"FY2018":0,"FY2019":0},"est_cost":16000000},"FY2015":{"plan":{"FY2015":3550,"FY2016":14000,"FY2017":0,"FY2018":0,"FY2019":0,"FY2020":0},"est_cost":17550000},"FY2016":{"plan":{"FY2016":0,"FY2017":2250,"FY2018":13000,"FY2019":2750,"FY2020":0,"FY2021":0},"est_cost":18000000},"FY2017":{"plan":{"FY2017":2250,"FY2018":13000,"FY2019":2750,"FY2020":0,"FY2021":0,"FY2022":0},"est_cost":18000000}},"cumulative_funding":{"funding_by_phase":{"(01) Design":{"FY2012":{"allotted":0,"spent":0,"proposed":0},"FY2013":{"allotted":0,"spent":0,"proposed":0},"FY2015":{"allotted":0,"spent":0,"proposed":1850}},"(02) SITE":{"FY2012":{"allotted":0,"spent":0,"proposed":0},"FY2015":{"allotted":0,"spent":0,"proposed":0}},"(03) Project Management":{"FY2012":{"allotted":0,"spent":0,"proposed":0},"FY2015":{"allotted":0,"spent":0,"proposed":1700},"FY2016":{"allotted":0,"spent":0,"proposed":0},"FY2017":{"allotted":0,"spent":0,"proposed":2250},"FY2018":{"allotted":2250,"spent":0,"proposed":13000},"FY2019":{"allotted":15250,"spent":0,"proposed":2750}},"(04) Construction":{"FY2014":{"allotted":0,"spent":0,"proposed":0},"FY2015":{"allotted":0,"spent":0,"proposed":0}},"(05) Equipment":{"FY2015":{"allotted":0,"spent":0,"proposed":0}}},"funding_by_source":{"GO Bonds - New (0300)":{"FY2012":{"allotted":0,"spent":0,"proposed":0},"FY2016":{"allotted":0,"spent":0,"proposed":0},"FY2017":{"allotted":0,"spent":0,"proposed":2250},"FY2018":{"allotted":2250,"spent":0,"proposed":13000},"FY2019":{"allotted":15250,"spent":0,"proposed":2750}},"Sales of Assets (0305)":{"FY2013":{"allotted":0,"spent":0,"proposed":0},"FY2014":{"allotted":0,"spent":0,"proposed":0},"FY2015":{"allotted":0,"spent":0,"proposed":3550}}},"total_funding":{"FY2012":{"allotted":0,"spent":0,"proposed":0},"FY2013":{"allotted":0,"spent":0,"proposed":0},"FY2015":{"allotted":0,"spent":0,"proposed":3550},"FY2016":{"allotted":0,"spent":0,"proposed":0},"FY2017":{"allotted":0,"spent":0,"proposed":2250},"FY2018":{"allotted":2250,"spent":0,"proposed":13000},"FY2019":{"allotted":15250,"spent":0,"proposed":2750},"FY2014":{"allotted":0,"spent":0,"proposed":0}}}}
