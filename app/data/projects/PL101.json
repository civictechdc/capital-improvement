These properties are heavily-used District assets that are occupied year-round, and subject to significant wear and tear.  There are a number of buildings that are in need of structural upgrades to maintain a well-working physical environment for our most vulnerable population.  This project is an essential part of the Mayor’s initiative to ensure we meet quality of life standards for the District’s shelter population. This project aligns with SustainableDC Action: Built Environment 3.1.","progress_assessment":"This is an ongoing pool project.","related_projects":"DHS projects THK16C-Temporary and Permanent Supportive Housing; HSW01C-Ward 1 Shelter; HSW03C-Ward3 Shelter; HSW04C-Ward4 Shelter; HSW05C-Ward 5 Shelter; HSW06C-Ward 6 Shelter; Ward 7 Shelter; HSW08C-Ward 8 Shelter","milestones":{"environmental_approvals":{},"design_start":{},"design_complete":{},"construction_start":{},"construction_complete":{},"closeout":{}},"useful_life":30,"facility":"N/A","est_cost":66665000,"lat":null,"lon":null,"first_year":2010,"last_year":2017,"cip_history":{"FY2010":{"plan":{"FY2010":2000,"FY2011":5250,"FY2012":5250,"FY2013":10500,"FY2014":10500,"FY2015":10500},"est_cost":null},"FY2011":{"plan":{"FY2011":5250,"FY2012":5250,"FY2013":5250,"FY2014":5250,"FY2015":5200,"FY2016":5200},"est_cost":null},"FY2017":{"plan":{"FY2017":9000,"FY2018":0,"FY2019":0,"FY2020":0,"FY2021":0,"FY2022":0},"est_cost":66665000}},"cumulative_funding":{"funding_by_phase":{"(01) Design":{"FY2010":{"allotted":7492,"spent":4675,"proposed":0},"FY2011":{"allotted":7292,"spent":5734,"proposed":1150},"FY2017":{"allotted":8935,"spent":8811,"proposed":0}},"(02) SITE":{"FY2010":{"allotted":14077,"spent":12783,"proposed":0},"FY2011":{"allotted":13354,"spent":12793,"proposed":0},"FY2017":{"allotted":10377,"spent":10377,"proposed":0}},"(03) Project Management":{"FY2010":{"allotted":3994,"spent":2755,"proposed":0},"FY2011":{"allotted":3844,"spent":2897,"proposed":1150},"FY2017":{"allotted":4624,"spent":4619,"proposed":0}},"(04) Construction":{"FY2010":{"allotted":21926,"spent":19388,"proposed":2000},"FY2011":{"allotted":25149,"spent":24958,"proposed":2950},"FY2017":{"allotted":33730,"spent":32664,"proposed":9000}},"(05) Equipment":{"FY2010":{"allotted":150,"spent":0,"proposed":0}}},"funding_by_source":{"GO Bonds - New (0300)":{"FY2010":{"allotted":45139,"spent":44677,"proposed":2000},"FY2011":{"allotted":47139,"spent":44263,"proposed":5250},"FY2017":{"allotted":54915,"spent":53977,"proposed":0}},"Pay Go (0301)":{"FY2010":{"allotted":2500,"spent":0,"proposed":0},"FY2011":{"allotted":2500,"spent":2500,"proposed":0},"FY2017":{"allotted":2750,"spent":2750,"proposed":0}},"Cap Fund - Fed Pmt (0355)":{"FY2017":{"allotted":0,"spent":0,"proposed":9000}}},"total_funding":{"FY2010":{"allotted":47639,"spent":39601,"proposed":2000},"FY2011":{"allotted":49639,"spent":46382,"proposed":5250},"FY2017":{"allotted":57666,"spent":56471,"proposed":9000}}}}
