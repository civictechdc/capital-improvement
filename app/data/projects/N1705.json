The data centers are old and in need of major infrastructure upgrades and have neither the space nor electrical power capacity to meet the District’s current and future requirements. The data centers are being relocated. OCTO Data Center 2 (ODC2) will relocate to a leased facility outside the District, and OCTO Data Center 1 (ODC1) will remain within the District in a leased facility.  This project will enable the implementation of distributed data and application services on geographically dispersed, remotely managed infrastructure that is secure, fault-tolerant, and has high-capacity and performance characteristics. The goal of the new data center architecture is to achieve uptime of 99.999% or better for applications hosted in the environment (equates to about 5 minutes of downtime per year).","justification":"The relocation of Data Center 1 will bring about enormous improvements in the environments used to provide critical public safety, public welfare, and government operations services to the District’s constituents.","progress_assessment":"In FY09 hardware was deployed to increase the operating capacity of the existing data centers. OCTO is in the procurement and deployment phases for the necessary hardware and software components supporting the data center relocations.","related_projects":"N2201 - Server Consolidation, N2702 - Enterprise Messaging and Communications Platform, and N2501C – Data Center Relocation.","milestones":{"environmental_approvals":{},"design_start":{"projected":"10/01/06","actual":"10/01/06"},"design_complete":{"projected":"09/30/08","actual":"09/30/08"},"construction_start":{"projected":"10/01/08"},"construction_complete":{"projected":"09/30/17"},"closeout":{"projected":"09/30/17"}},"useful_life":15,"facility":"N/A","ward":"","est_cost":57434000,"lat":null,"lon":null,"first_year":2010,"last_year":2012,"cip_history":{"FY2010":{"FY2010":0,"FY2011":0,"FY2012":0,"FY2013":0,"FY2014":0,"FY2015":1000},"FY2011":{"FY2011":0,"FY2012":0,"FY2013":0,"FY2014":0,"FY2015":500,"FY2016":0},"FY2012":{"FY2012":0,"FY2013":0,"FY2014":0,"FY2015":500,"FY2016":0,"FY2017":0}},"cumulative_funding":{"funding_by_phase":{"(01) Design":{"FY2010":{"allotted":55434,"spent":53044,"proposed":0},"FY2011":{"allotted":55434,"spent":55001,"proposed":0},"FY2012":{"allotted":55434,"spent":54857,"proposed":0}},"(02) SITE":{"FY2010":{"allotted":596,"spent":370,"proposed":0},"FY2011":{"allotted":596,"spent":539,"proposed":0},"FY2012":{"allotted":596,"spent":596,"proposed":0}},"(03) Project Management":{"FY2010":{"allotted":11830,"spent":11486,"proposed":0},"FY2011":{"allotted":11830,"spent":11565,"proposed":0},"FY2012":{"allotted":11830,"spent":11794,"proposed":0}},"(05) Equipment":{"FY2010":{"allotted":33407,"spent":31894,"proposed":0},"FY2011":{"allotted":33407,"spent":33350,"proposed":0},"FY2012":{"allotted":33407,"spent":33115,"proposed":0}},"(06) IT Requirements Development/Systems Design":{"FY2010":{"allotted":636,"spent":417,"proposed":0},"FY2011":{"allotted":636,"spent":616,"proposed":0},"FY2012":{"allotted":636,"spent":422,"proposed":0}}},"funding_by_source":{"GO Bonds - New (0300)":{"FY2010":{"allotted":51673,"spent":49475,"proposed":0},"FY2011":{"allotted":51673,"spent":51546,"proposed":0},"FY2012":{"allotted":51673,"spent":51575,"proposed":0}},"Pay Go (0301)":{"FY2010":{"allotted":1375,"spent":1375,"proposed":0},"FY2011":{"allotted":1375,"spent":1375,"proposed":0},"FY2012":{"allotted":1375,"spent":1375,"proposed":0}},"Alternative Financing (0303)":{"FY2010":{"allotted":2386,"spent":2194,"proposed":0},"FY2011":{"allotted":2386,"spent":2194,"proposed":0},"FY2012":{"allotted":2386,"spent":2295,"proposed":0}}},"total_funding":{"FY2010":{"allotted":55434,"spent":53044,"proposed":0},"FY2011":{"allotted":55434,"spent":55001,"proposed":0},"FY2012":{"allotted":55434,"spent":54857,"proposed":0}}}}
