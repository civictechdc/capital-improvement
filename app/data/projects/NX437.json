Facility components such as roofs, boilers, and windows are failing, and costly maintenance procedures are unable to correct these problems. Costs increase as these deficiencies continue and the ability of the school to deliver quality curriculum in the classrooms is diminished. This project will also eliminate the many facility emergencies that occur as the result of years of deferred maintenance. The improvements will be accomplished through a revitalization of all major systems and components including roofs, windows and frames, exterior and interior doors and frames, exterior walls, site work, interior finishes, electrical, mechanical, life-safety equipment and compliance with legislative requirements, including health and safety issues and the Americans with Disabilities Act(ADA).","justification":"This project is included in the Master Facilities Plan adopted by Section 4111 of the Fiscal Year 2011 Budget Support Act of 2010.","progress_assessment":"-","related_projects":"See MFP.","milestones":{"environmental_approvals":{},"design_start":{"projected":"03/01/09"},"design_complete":{"projected":"03/01/10"},"construction_start":{"projected":"06/01/10"},"construction_complete":{"projected":"08/15/12"},"closeout":{}},"est_cost":59396000,"useful_life":30,"lat":38.87008406,"lon":-76.98307725,"first_year":2012,"last_year":2012,"cip_history":{"FY2012":{"FY2012":26715,"FY2013":0,"FY2014":0,"FY2015":0,"FY2016":0,"FY2017":0}},"cumulative_funding":{"funding_by_phase":{"(01) Design":{"FY2012":{"allotted":32681,"spent":29956,"proposed":26715}},"(03) Project Management":{"FY2012":{"allotted":105,"spent":105,"proposed":0}},"(04) Construction":{"FY2012":{"allotted":29560,"spent":27003,"proposed":26715}},"(05) Equipment":{"FY2012":{"allotted":110,"spent":110,"proposed":0}}},"funding_by_source":{"GO Bonds - New (0300)":{"FY2012":{"allotted":32681,"spent":29956,"proposed":26715}}},"total_funding":{"FY2012":{"allotted":32681,"spent":29956,"proposed":26715}}}}
