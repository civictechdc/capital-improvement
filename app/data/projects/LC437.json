{"active":false,"project_no":"LC437","title":"ENGINE 22 FIREHOUSE REPLACEMENT","agency":"FIRE AND EMERGENCY MEDICAL SERVICES (FB0)","implementing_agency":"DEPARTMENT OF GENERAL SERVICES (AM0)","ward":"4","location":"5760 GEORGIA AVENUE NW","facility":"ENGINE 22","status":"Ongoing Subprojects","description":"A site for the new Engine 22 has been selected on the southeast corner of Georgia Avenue and Butternut Street NW. An architect has been selected to design a 30,000 square foot four bay facility that can provide the community with effective Fire and EMS Service and provide underground parking for our members, a new state-of-the-art fire station as well as a back up Fire Operations Center and a community room for public use.","justification":"This project is necessary because the current Engine 22 was built in 1897 and has long outlived its life expectancy, making the project is extremly urgent. It will benefit the District taxpayers by lowering response times to the northern portion of Engine 22's response area and by allowing the members of Engine 22 to work and live in a modern, safe and efficient fire station. This project supports the Mayor's priorities by moving Engine 22, Truck 11 and Ambulance 22 further north and reducing response times in the northern portion of their response area. This project aligns with SustainableDC Action: Built Environment 3.5.","progress_assessment":"FEMS and DGS are proceeding with the design phase for a new Engine 22 on the southeast corner of Georgia Avenue and Butternut Street NW. The project construction is on hold pending the transfer from the U.S Army of the Walter Reed campus at Georgia Avenue and Aspen Street NW. Therefore, budget is approved for construction in FY 2014 and FY 2015.","related_projects":"The relocation of Engine 26 is related to this project. FEMS needs to build a new station for Engine 26 further east in their response area to reduce response times.","milestones":{"environmental_approvals":{},"design_start":{"projected":"03/01/11"},"design_complete":{"projected":"09/30/12"},"construction_start":{"projected":"10/05/13"},"construction_complete":{"projected":"07/31/14"},"closeout":{"projected":"09/30/14"}},"useful_life":30,"est_cost":12288000,"lat":38.95998141,"lon":-77.0283388,"first_year":2011,"last_year":2015,"cip_history":{"FY2011":{"plan":{"FY2011":5100,"FY2012":0,"FY2013":0,"FY2014":0,"FY2015":0,"FY2016":0},"est_cost":null},"FY2012":{"plan":{"FY2012":4700,"FY2013":0,"FY2014":0,"FY2015":0,"FY2016":0,"FY2017":0},"est_cost":5951322},"FY2013":{"plan":{"FY2013":0,"FY2014":8000,"FY2015":4000,"FY2016":0,"FY2017":0,"FY2018":0},"est_cost":12000000},"FY2014":{"plan":{"FY2014":8000,"FY2015":4000,"FY2016":0,"FY2017":0,"FY2018":0,"FY2019":0},"est_cost":12288000},"FY2015":{"plan":{"FY2015":4000,"FY2016":0,"FY2017":0,"FY2018":0,"FY2019":0,"FY2020":0},"est_cost":12288000}},"cumulative_funding":{"funding_by_phase":{"(01) Design":{"FY2011":{"allotted":2200,"spent":1408,"proposed":0},"FY2012":{"allotted":2200,"spent":1607,"proposed":0},"FY2013":{"allotted":288,"spent":288,"proposed":0},"FY2014":{"allotted":288,"spent":288,"proposed":114},"FY2015":{"allotted":917,"spent":410,"proposed":124}},"(02) SITE":{"FY2011":{"allotted":1600,"spent":1600,"proposed":0},"FY2012":{"allotted":1600,"spent":1600,"proposed":0}},"(03) Project Management":{"FY2011":{"allotted":1060,"spent":0,"proposed":218},"FY2012":{"allotted":1278,"spent":0,"proposed":0}},"(04) Construction":{"FY2011":{"allotted":4864,"spent":4077,"proposed":4882},"FY2012":{"allotted":9746,"spent":4078,"proposed":4700},"FY2013":{"allotted":0,"spent":0,"proposed":0},"FY2014":{"allotted":0,"spent":0,"proposed":7886},"FY2015":{"allotted":7371,"spent":0,"proposed":3876}}},"funding_by_source":{"GO Bonds - New (0300)":{"FY2011":{"allotted":9724,"spent":7085,"proposed":5100},"FY2012":{"allotted":14824,"spent":7285,"proposed":4700},"FY2013":{"allotted":288,"spent":288,"proposed":0},"FY2014":{"allotted":288,"spent":288,"proposed":8000},"FY2015":{"allotted":8288,"spent":410,"proposed":4000}}},"total_funding":{"FY2011":{"allotted":9724,"spent":7085,"proposed":5100},"FY2012":{"allotted":14824,"spent":7285,"proposed":4700},"FY2013":{"allotted":288,"spent":288,"proposed":0},"FY2014":{"allotted":288,"spent":288,"proposed":8000},"FY2015":{"allotted":8288,"spent":410,"proposed":4000}}}}
