Examples of vehicles included in the replacement plan include sanitation vehicles, maintenance and inspection vehicles, dump trucks, and emergency service vehicles.","justification":"Capital investment in the Districtâ€™s fleet is necessary to ensure seamless service delivery of many District operations. This project will enable the Department to secure major durable equipment items that have long lead times between the placement of the order and the delivery of the item. Further, the project is expected to have a beneficial impact on the operating budget by eliminating the need for expedited processing of long lead time equipment orders, which disrupt regular work flow, and the efficiency of the procurement process. This project aligns with SustainableDC Action: Transportation 4.2.","progress_assessment":"The project is progressing as planned.","related_projects":"EQ903C-Heavy Equipment Acquisition - DPW","milestones":{"environmental_approvals":{},"design_start":{},"design_complete":{},"construction_start":{},"construction_complete":{},"closeout":{}},"useful_life":10,"ward":"","facility":"EQUIPMENT","est_cost":119673000,"lat":null,"lon":null,"first_year":2010,"last_year":2015,"cip_history":{"FY2010":{"plan":{"FY2010":6000,"FY2011":7560,"FY2012":7800,"FY2013":7800,"FY2014":7800,"FY2015":1500},"est_cost":null},"FY2011":{"plan":{"FY2011":8927,"FY2012":1704,"FY2013":1000,"FY2014":4116,"FY2015":3850,"FY2016":2989},"est_cost":null},"FY2012":{"plan":{"FY2012":5992,"FY2013":1900,"FY2014":3316,"FY2015":3850,"FY2016":1789,"FY2017":900},"est_cost":129429000},"FY2013":{"plan":{"FY2013":0,"FY2014":0,"FY2015":500,"FY2016":1789,"FY2017":900,"FY2018":1500},"est_cost":122362000},"FY2014":{"plan":{"FY2014":1000,"FY2015":1000,"FY2016":0,"FY2017":0,"FY2018":0,"FY2019":0},"est_cost":119673000},"FY2015":{"plan":{"FY2015":1000,"FY2016":0,"FY2017":0,"FY2018":0,"FY2019":0,"FY2020":0},"est_cost":119673000}},"cumulative_funding":{"funding_by_phase":{"(05) Equipment":{"FY2010":{"allotted":92927,"spent":89666,"proposed":6000},"FY2011":{"allotted":98927,"spent":98768,"proposed":8927},"FY2012":{"allotted":111681,"spent":107508,"proposed":5992},"FY2013":{"allotted":117673,"spent":115451,"proposed":0},"FY2014":{"allotted":117673,"spent":116536,"proposed":1000},"FY2015":{"allotted":118155,"spent":117343,"proposed":1000}}},"funding_by_source":{"GO Bonds - New (0300)":{"FY2010":{"allotted":49949,"spent":49615,"proposed":0},"FY2011":{"allotted":49949,"spent":49615,"proposed":0},"FY2012":{"allotted":49949,"spent":48313,"proposed":0},"FY2013":{"allotted":49949,"spent":48313,"proposed":0},"FY2014":{"allotted":49949,"spent":48581,"proposed":0},"FY2015":{"allotted":48776,"spent":48606,"proposed":0}},"Equipment Lease (0302)":{"FY2010":{"allotted":42978,"spent":39383,"proposed":6000},"FY2011":{"allotted":48978,"spent":48803,"proposed":8927},"FY2012":{"allotted":61732,"spent":59196,"proposed":5992},"FY2013":{"allotted":67724,"spent":67138,"proposed":0},"FY2014":{"allotted":67724,"spent":67494,"proposed":1000},"FY2015":{"allotted":69378,"spent":68396,"proposed":1000}}},"total_funding":{"FY2010":{"allotted":92927,"spent":89666,"proposed":6000},"FY2011":{"allotted":98927,"spent":98768,"proposed":8927},"FY2012":{"allotted":111681,"spent":107508,"proposed":5992},"FY2013":{"allotted":117673,"spent":115451,"proposed":0},"FY2014":{"allotted":117673,"spent":116536,"proposed":1000},"FY2015":{"allotted":118155,"spent":117343,"proposed":1000}}}}
