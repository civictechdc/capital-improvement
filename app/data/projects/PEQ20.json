{"active":false,"project_no":"PEQ20","title":"SPECIALIZED VEHICLES - MPD","agency":"METROPOLITAN POLICE DEPARTMENT (FA0)","implementing_agency":"EQUIPMENT LEASE - CAPITAL (ELC)","location":"DISTRICT-WIDE","status":"Ongoing Subprojects","description":"Project requirements are to support the annual replacement of the Police patrol cars for MPD, currently on a 5 year replacement schedule. As part of the Public Justice cluster, MPD requires the replacement vehicles to support daily police operations, as required by law and the citizens of the District of Columbia to preserve law and order within the District. The goal is to maintain the existing fleet of police vehicles according to an established replacement cycle.  This project's budget returns the MPD to a required funding level.","justification":"MPDâ€™s fleet program is a part of the citywide Master Lease program.  MPD maintains 1,639 vehicles in the fleet including 802 marked cruisers, 409 unmarked cruisers, and 428 specialty/support vehicles. The Department seeks to continue the replacement cycle of patrol cars, motorcycles and related equipment required to operate these vehicles.  The replacement schedule for FY 2009 and FY 2010 has been modified to account for the reduced funding levels.  Long term projections on impact have not been completed. This project aligns with SustainableDC Action: Transportation 4.2.","progress_assessment":"MPD will continue to replace vehicles in accordance with the preferred replacement cycle for patrol vehicles.","related_projects":"PEQ22C-Specialized Vehicles-MPD","milestones":{"environmental_approvals":{},"design_start":{},"design_complete":{},"construction_start":{},"construction_complete":{},"closeout":{"projected":"09/30/21"}},"useful_life":5,"facility":"VEHICLES","ward":"","est_cost":106736000,"lat":null,"lon":null,"first_year":2010,"last_year":2016,"cip_history":{"FY2010":{"plan":{"FY2010":2500,"FY2011":5000,"FY2012":5200,"FY2013":5200,"FY2014":5200,"FY2015":5200},"est_cost":null},"FY2011":{"plan":{"FY2011":5000,"FY2012":2000,"FY2013":6200,"FY2014":2600,"FY2015":3000,"FY2016":5200},"est_cost":null},"FY2012":{"plan":{"FY2012":4000,"FY2013":4200,"FY2014":2399,"FY2015":3050,"FY2016":5200,"FY2017":5200},"est_cost":81039000},"FY2013":{"plan":{"FY2013":4200,"FY2014":1711,"FY2015":3050,"FY2016":5200,"FY2017":5200,"FY2018":0},"est_cost":81039000},"FY2014":{"plan":{"FY2014":1711,"FY2015":3050,"FY2016":4000,"FY2017":0,"FY2018":0,"FY2019":0},"est_cost":73951000},"FY2015":{"plan":{"FY2015":4550,"FY2016":5000,"FY2017":0,"FY2018":0,"FY2019":10000,"FY2020":10000},"est_cost":96608000},"FY2016":{"plan":{"FY2016":5000,"FY2017":6500,"FY2018":0,"FY2019":10000,"FY2020":10000,"FY2021":0},"est_cost":106736000}},"cumulative_funding":{"funding_by_phase":{"(05) Equipment":{"FY2010":{"allotted":49490,"spent":49127,"proposed":2500},"FY2011":{"allotted":51990,"spent":50615,"proposed":5000},"FY2012":{"allotted":56990,"spent":54780,"proposed":4000},"FY2013":{"allotted":60990,"spent":60973,"proposed":4200},"FY2014":{"allotted":65190,"spent":65129,"proposed":1711},"FY2015":{"allotted":67059,"spent":67045,"proposed":4550},"FY2016":{"allotted":75236,"spent":75212,"proposed":5000}}},"funding_by_source":{"GO Bonds - New (0300)":{"FY2010":{"allotted":21375,"spent":21373,"proposed":0},"FY2011":{"allotted":21375,"spent":21373,"proposed":0},"FY2012":{"allotted":21375,"spent":21373,"proposed":0},"FY2013":{"allotted":21375,"spent":21373,"proposed":0},"FY2014":{"allotted":21375,"spent":21373,"proposed":0},"FY2015":{"allotted":21375,"spent":21373,"proposed":0},"FY2016":{"allotted":21324,"spent":21316,"proposed":0}},"Equipment Lease (0302)":{"FY2010":{"allotted":28115,"spent":27750,"proposed":2500},"FY2011":{"allotted":30615,"spent":29237,"proposed":5000},"FY2012":{"allotted":35615,"spent":33407,"proposed":4000},"FY2013":{"allotted":39615,"spent":39601,"proposed":4200},"FY2014":{"allotted":43815,"spent":43756,"proposed":1711},"FY2015":{"allotted":45684,"spent":45672,"proposed":4550},"FY2016":{"allotted":53912,"spent":53896,"proposed":5000}}},"total_funding":{"FY2010":{"allotted":49490,"spent":49127,"proposed":2500},"FY2011":{"allotted":51990,"spent":50615,"proposed":5000},"FY2012":{"allotted":56990,"spent":54780,"proposed":4000},"FY2013":{"allotted":60990,"spent":60973,"proposed":4200},"FY2014":{"allotted":65190,"spent":65129,"proposed":1711},"FY2015":{"allotted":67059,"spent":67045,"proposed":4550},"FY2016":{"allotted":75236,"spent":75212,"proposed":5000}}}}
