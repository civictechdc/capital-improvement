{"active":false,"project_no":"N1603","title":"CITYWIDE NETWORK INFRASTRUCTURE UPGRADE","agency":"OFFICE OF CHIEF TECHNOLOGY OFFICER (TO0)","implementing_agency":"EQUIPMENT LEASE - CAPITAL (ELC)","location":"DISTRICT-WIDE","status":"Ongoing Subprojects","description":"District agencies’ technology needs are placing an increasing reliance on the District Government data network for services it now supports, as well as additional network based services it will need to support—such  as video, collaboration and increased mobility. The DC Wide Area Network (WAN) N1603C project began in FY08 and will continue through FY19 to provide continuous improvement on the network infrastructure including LAN/WAN/Telephony and systems needed to maintain a state–of-the-art, secure, fault tolerant network and satisfy the future demands of District agencies.","justification":"This project allows for the improvement of the citywide network infrastructure. Improvements will include network infrastructure upgrades of legacy systems to leverage advances in technology and capabilities and additional resources to add bandwidth and throughput processing power. This project ensures the availability of critical services that OCTO provides to the entire District. Legacy network capabilities and capacity will not keep pace with the demands of new technology and potential growth for new agency IT initiatives.","progress_assessment":"This project is progressing as planned in conjunction with N1601B. Since 2010, this project produced needed network equipment to improve existing network capacity and capabilities. It deployed the network infrastructure necessary to provide government and public wireless internet access at government locations, including parks and recreation facilities, schools.    Provided network connectivity through major capital modernization programs at several new buildings, such as, the District building at 2001 Street and the Consolidated Forensic Lab (CFL).     As part of the schools network modernization program for DCPS, relocated administrative office personnel from 11 DCPS sites to alternative locations and reinstated full continuity of service in virtually transparent deployments within two business days. Completed the network upgrade for a total of 20 schools in the summer of 2012.  This massive undertaking allowed both structural and IT upgrades to be completed during the summer months and ensured fully enhanced educational facilities when the teachers and children were moved back for the fall semester.","related_projects":"N1603C is a continuation of the N1601B Capital project.","milestones":{"environmental_approvals":{},"design_start":{"projected":"10/01/07","actual":"10/01/07"},"design_complete":{"projected":"01/15/15"},"construction_start":{"projected":"02/01/08","actual":"02/11/08"},"construction_complete":{"projected":"09/30/20"},"closeout":{"projected":"12/31/21"}},"useful_life":10,"facility":"NETWORK","ward":"","est_cost":6391000,"lat":null,"lon":null,"first_year":2010,"last_year":2015,"cip_history":{"FY2010":{"plan":{"FY2010":1215,"FY2011":1486,"FY2012":2814,"FY2013":2814,"FY2014":1762,"FY2015":1800},"est_cost":null},"FY2011":{"plan":{"FY2011":743,"FY2012":1600,"FY2013":2104,"FY2014":881,"FY2015":1000,"FY2016":1800},"est_cost":null},"FY2012":{"plan":{"FY2012":1600,"FY2013":2104,"FY2014":881,"FY2015":1000,"FY2016":1800,"FY2017":3848},"est_cost":16505000},"FY2013":{"plan":{"FY2013":0,"FY2014":2385,"FY2015":500,"FY2016":1800,"FY2017":3848,"FY2018":3000},"est_cost":14858000},"FY2014":{"plan":{"FY2014":2385,"FY2015":500,"FY2016":0,"FY2017":0,"FY2018":0,"FY2019":0},"est_cost":6210000},"FY2015":{"plan":{"FY2015":500,"FY2016":0,"FY2017":0,"FY2018":0,"FY2019":0,"FY2020":0},"est_cost":6391000}},"cumulative_funding":{"funding_by_phase":{"(05) Equipment":{"FY2010":{"allotted":2814,"spent":922,"proposed":1215},"FY2011":{"allotted":4029,"spent":1725,"proposed":743},"FY2012":{"allotted":1725,"spent":1724,"proposed":1600},"FY2013":{"allotted":3325,"spent":1724,"proposed":0},"FY2014":{"allotted":3325,"spent":3268,"proposed":2385},"FY2015":{"allotted":6341,"spent":3384,"proposed":500}}},"funding_by_source":{"Equipment Lease (0302)":{"FY2010":{"allotted":2814,"spent":922,"proposed":1215},"FY2011":{"allotted":4029,"spent":1725,"proposed":743},"FY2012":{"allotted":1725,"spent":1724,"proposed":1600},"FY2013":{"allotted":3325,"spent":1724,"proposed":0},"FY2014":{"allotted":3325,"spent":3268,"proposed":2385},"FY2015":{"allotted":6341,"spent":3384,"proposed":500}}},"total_funding":{"FY2010":{"allotted":2814,"spent":922,"proposed":1215},"FY2011":{"allotted":4029,"spent":1725,"proposed":743},"FY2012":{"allotted":1725,"spent":1724,"proposed":1600},"FY2013":{"allotted":3325,"spent":1724,"proposed":0},"FY2014":{"allotted":3325,"spent":3268,"proposed":2385},"FY2015":{"allotted":6341,"spent":3384,"proposed":500}}}}
