{"active":true,"project_no":"AW000","title":"SOUTH CAPITOL STREET CORRIDOR","agency":"DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION (KA0)","implementing_agency":"DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION (KA0)","ward":"","location":"VARIOUS","status":"In multiple phases","description":"The proposed improvements to South Capitol Street are intended to realize the vision set forth in the L’Enfant Plan through downgrading South Capitol Street from an expressway to an urban boulevard and gateway to the District of Columbia’s Monumental Core.  A key feature of this project will be the construction of a new and architecturally significant Frederick Douglass Memorial/South Capitol Street Bridge. This structure will spark the transformation of the South Capitol Street corridor and create a world class gateway between the east and west sides of the Anacostia River. Additional park lands will be created in the area adjacent to the new bridge to promote liveable communities, expand recreational options, and reconnect the city to the Anacostia riverfront. Economic development opportunities will be created and improved connectivity for residents will be provided to federal installations and job centers, including enhanced access to the Department of Homeland Security, U.S. Navy Yard, Bolling Air Force Base, the Anacostia Annex, and Andrews Air Force Base in Maryland.","related_projects":"All projects assigned to master project AW000A-South Capitol Street Corridor in Appendix H, Table 3.","useful_life":30,"lat":null,"lon":null,"first_year":2012,"last_year":2022,"cip_history":{"FY2012":{"plan":{"FY2012":16200,"FY2013":52398,"FY2014":24345,"FY2015":37888,"FY2016":39151,"FY2017":0},"est_cost":null},"FY2013":{"plan":{"FY2013":0,"FY2014":0,"FY2015":0,"FY2016":21341,"FY2017":21003,"FY2018":27118},"est_cost":null},"FY2014":{"plan":{"FY2014":51495,"FY2015":0,"FY2016":11440,"FY2017":33760,"FY2018":32430,"FY2019":18010},"est_cost":null},"FY2015":{"plan":{"FY2015":20000,"FY2016":12320,"FY2017":40350,"FY2018":32450,"FY2019":18030,"FY2020":18030},"est_cost":null},"FY2016":{"plan":{"FY2016":0,"FY2017":0,"FY2018":19734,"FY2019":19126,"FY2020":18410,"FY2021":17550},"est_cost":null},"FY2017":{"plan":{"FY2017":12600,"FY2018":4600,"FY2019":17100,"FY2020":23600,"FY2021":23600,"FY2022":23600},"est_cost":null}},"cumulative_funding":{"funding_by_phase":{"(03) Project Management":{"FY2012":{"allotted":0,"spent":0,"proposed":1146},"FY2015":{"allotted":245,"spent":0,"proposed":0},"FY2016":{"allotted":245,"spent":0,"proposed":0},"FY2017":{"allotted":245,"spent":0,"proposed":0},"FY2018":{"allotted":245,"spent":0,"proposed":0},"FY2019":{"allotted":245,"spent":0,"proposed":0},"FY2020":{"allotted":245,"spent":0,"proposed":0},"FY2021":{"allotted":245,"spent":0,"proposed":0},"FY2022":{"allotted":245,"spent":0,"proposed":0}},"(04) Construction":{"FY2012":{"allotted":0,"spent":0,"proposed":15054},"FY2013":{"allotted":5950,"spent":0,"proposed":0},"FY2014":{"allotted":5794,"spent":0,"proposed":51495},"FY2015":{"allotted":51314,"spent":0,"proposed":20000},"FY2016":{"allotted":71314,"spent":0,"proposed":0},"FY2017":{"allotted":43230,"spent":0,"proposed":12600},"FY2018":{"allotted":55830,"spent":0,"proposed":4600},"FY2019":{"allotted":60430,"spent":0,"proposed":17100},"FY2020":{"allotted":77530,"spent":0,"proposed":23600},"FY2021":{"allotted":101130,"spent":0,"proposed":23600},"FY2022":{"allotted":124730,"spent":0,"proposed":23600}}},"funding_by_source":{"Highway Trust Fund (0320)":{"FY2012":{"allotted":0,"spent":0,"proposed":3696},"FY2013":{"allotted":106,"spent":0,"proposed":0},"FY2014":{"allotted":91,"spent":0,"proposed":10245},"FY2015":{"allotted":14637,"spent":0,"proposed":3771},"FY2016":{"allotted":18408,"spent":0,"proposed":0},"FY2017":{"allotted":12883,"spent":0,"proposed":300},"FY2018":{"allotted":13183,"spent":0,"proposed":0},"FY2019":{"allotted":13183,"spent":0,"proposed":0},"FY2020":{"allotted":13183,"spent":0,"proposed":0},"FY2021":{"allotted":13183,"spent":0,"proposed":0},"FY2022":{"allotted":13183,"spent":0,"proposed":0}},"Federal (0350)":{"FY2012":{"allotted":0,"spent":0,"proposed":12503},"FY2013":{"allotted":5844,"spent":0,"proposed":0},"FY2014":{"allotted":5703,"spent":0,"proposed":41250},"FY2015":{"allotted":36921,"spent":0,"proposed":16229},"FY2016":{"allotted":53150,"spent":0,"proposed":0},"FY2017":{"allotted":30592,"spent":0,"proposed":12300},"FY2018":{"allotted":42892,"spent":0,"proposed":4600},"FY2019":{"allotted":47492,"spent":0,"proposed":17100},"FY2020":{"allotted":64592,"spent":0,"proposed":23600},"FY2021":{"allotted":88192,"spent":0,"proposed":23600},"FY2022":{"allotted":111792,"spent":0,"proposed":23600}}},"total_funding":{"FY2012":{"allotted":0,"spent":0,"proposed":16200},"FY2015":{"allotted":51559,"spent":0,"proposed":20000},"FY2016":{"allotted":71559,"spent":0,"proposed":0},"FY2017":{"allotted":43475,"spent":0,"proposed":12600},"FY2018":{"allotted":56075,"spent":0,"proposed":4600},"FY2019":{"allotted":60675,"spent":0,"proposed":17100},"FY2020":{"allotted":77775,"spent":0,"proposed":23600},"FY2021":{"allotted":101375,"spent":0,"proposed":23600},"FY2022":{"allotted":124975,"spent":0,"proposed":23600},"FY2013":{"allotted":5950,"spent":0,"proposed":0},"FY2014":{"allotted":5794,"spent":0,"proposed":51495}}},"est_cost":148575000}
