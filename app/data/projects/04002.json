The subproject consists of acquisition, assemblage, site preparations, and demolition and stabilization of property to promote housing, affordable housing, and economic development opportunities. Projects for acquisition are identified in areas where the District can make an investment to enhance and complement development projects being undertaken by the private or non-profit sectors, as well as neighborhoods with substantial concentrations of vacant and abandoned property. Acquisition methods include friendly sales, tax foreclosures, and eminent domain. Included are technical studies, appraisals, environmental assessments, title reviews, and other acquisition expenses, in addition to the actual cost of acquisition of real property. Also included are costs of demolition, site improvements and other site preparation costs associated with acquisitions of real property. Finally, once the property is owned by the District, this project pays for costs related to the rehabilitation and the stabilization of the real property, including but not limited to engineering and/or architectural reports and drawings, as well as the development of solicitation for offers. Disposition methods include solicitations for offers, auctions of scattered sites, a combination solicitation and lottery for developers and homebuyers, as well as negotiated sales.
