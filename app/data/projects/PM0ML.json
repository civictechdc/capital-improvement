DDOTâ€™s facility is located in an old house, is beyond its useful life, and must be upgraded.  While FHWA will pay for materials certification and tests, federal funds cannot be used for construction of a new facility or for capital improvements to an existing facility.","justification":"Both the Department of General Services and DC Water are advancing plans for new maintenance sites.  Facilities include a reconstructed Spingarn High School and new maintenance yards on West Virginia Avenue.  DDOT would like to leverage one of these investments to lower the costs of a much-needed replacement of the Materials Testing Lab.     This project will help ensure that DDOT continues to be a recipient of FHWA funds, that tests and processes comply with audits and regulations, and that the materials that are used in transportation projects are appropriate for safety and durability.","progress_assessment":"New project.","related_projects":"All projects in the FHWA program","milestones":{"environmental_approvals":{},"design_start":{},"design_complete":{},"construction_start":{},"construction_complete":{},"closeout":{}},"est_cost":2000000,"useful_life":30,"lat":null,"lon":null,"first_year":2015,"last_year":2015,"cip_history":{"FY2015":{"FY2015":2000,"FY2016":0,"FY2017":0,"FY2018":0,"FY2019":0,"FY2020":0}},"cumulative_funding":{"funding_by_phase":{"(04) Construction":{"FY2015":{"allotted":0,"spent":0,"proposed":2000}}},"funding_by_source":{"GO Bonds - New (0300)":{"FY2015":{"allotted":0,"spent":0,"proposed":2000}}},"total_funding":{"FY2015":{"allotted":0,"spent":0,"proposed":2000}}}}
