The EGMS will replace the legacy application, the DC ONE APP. Additionally; EGMS replaces a manual, paper-based grant process that the agency was utilizing.","justification":"EGMS offers a wide range of benefits to all of those involved in improving student learning across the District of Columbia. The system provides a unified application, consolidating key components of grants management and compliance, including federal and local assurances, as well as offering enhanced reporting and accountability.  EGMS expands the capacity to audit, monitor, and report on grant activities and expenditures for grant compliance (90+ grant programs, 221 schools, 500+ childcare centers). EGMS also reduces waste and controls costs by improving workflowautomation. Last, EGMS will allow for a One Stop Portal data system that will allow all constituents easy access to grants including scholarships.","progress_assessment":"Ongoing project.","related_projects":"N/A","milestones":{"environmental_approvals":{},"design_start":{},"design_complete":{},"construction_start":{},"construction_complete":{},"closeout":{}},"est_cost":4000000,"lat":null,"lon":null,"first_year":2016,"last_year":2018,"cip_history":{"FY2016":{"FY2016":2500,"FY2017":1000,"FY2018":500,"FY2019":500,"FY2020":0,"FY2021":0},"FY2017":{"FY2017":1000,"FY2018":500,"FY2019":0,"FY2020":0,"FY2021":0,"FY2022":0}},"cumulative_funding":{"funding_by_phase":{"(06) IT Requirements Development/Systems Design":{"FY2016":{"allotted":0,"spent":0,"proposed":2500},"FY2017":{"allotted":2500,"spent":2446,"proposed":1000},"FY2018":{"allotted":3500,"spent":2446,"proposed":500}}},"funding_by_source":{"GO Bonds - New (0300)":{"FY2016":{"allotted":0,"spent":0,"proposed":2500},"FY2017":{"allotted":2500,"spent":2446,"proposed":1000},"FY2018":{"allotted":3500,"spent":2446,"proposed":500}}},"total_funding":{"FY2016":{"allotted":0,"spent":0,"proposed":2500},"FY2017":{"allotted":2500,"spent":2446,"proposed":1000},"FY2018":{"allotted":3500,"spent":2446,"proposed":500}}}}
