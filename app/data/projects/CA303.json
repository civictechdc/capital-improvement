{"active":true,"project_no":"CA303","title":"STORMWATER MANAGEMENT","agency":"DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION (KA0)","implementing_agency":"DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION (KA0)","location":"DISTRICT-WIDE","status":"Ongoing Subprojects","description":"This project repairs and maintains culverts throughout the District. Culverts facilitate the drainage of water and help to ensure the stabilization of roadway structures. The safety of roadway structures is a priority of the Mayor, and a concern for District residents, commuters, and visitors. This project also maintains an inventory for all the culverts owned and maintained by the District Department of Transportation (DDOT) and a formal maintenance and repair plan.","justification":"This project is necessary because of its safety impact on roadways.  Because culverts support roadway structures, the lack of drainage provided by culverts could have a severe impact on the functionality and safety on roads. This project aligns with SustainableDC Action: Water 2.2.","progress_assessment":"DDOT’s inventory system maintains a systematic and comprehensive evaluation process which allows for routine maintenance and scheduled repairs.This, in conjunction with DDOT’s bridge inspection program, provides preventative safety measures on the District’s bridges and culverts.","related_projects":"DDOT has a federal-aid bridge inspection program that inspects the District’s bridges.","milestones":{"environmental_approvals":{},"design_start":{},"design_complete":{},"construction_start":{},"construction_complete":{},"closeout":{}},"useful_life":30,"ward":"","est_cost":8945000,"facility":"LOCAL STREETS","lat":null,"lon":null,"first_year":2011,"last_year":2022,"cip_history":{"FY2011":{"plan":{"FY2011":400,"FY2012":400,"FY2013":400,"FY2014":400,"FY2015":400,"FY2016":400},"est_cost":null},"FY2012":{"plan":{"FY2012":400,"FY2013":300,"FY2014":300,"FY2015":300,"FY2016":300,"FY2017":250},"est_cost":0},"FY2013":{"plan":{"FY2013":300,"FY2014":300,"FY2015":300,"FY2016":300,"FY2017":300,"FY2018":300},"est_cost":7287000},"FY2014":{"plan":{"FY2014":250,"FY2015":250,"FY2016":250,"FY2017":250,"FY2018":250,"FY2019":250},"est_cost":7887000},"FY2015":{"plan":{"FY2015":250,"FY2016":250,"FY2017":250,"FY2018":0,"FY2019":250,"FY2020":250},"est_cost":7887000},"FY2016":{"plan":{"FY2016":250,"FY2017":250,"FY2018":0,"FY2019":0,"FY2020":250,"FY2021":0},"est_cost":7645000},"FY2017":{"plan":{"FY2017":300,"FY2018":300,"FY2019":300,"FY2020":300,"FY2021":300,"FY2022":300},"est_cost":8945000}},"cumulative_funding":{"funding_by_phase":{"(01) Design":{"FY2011":{"allotted":180,"spent":113,"proposed":0},"FY2012":{"allotted":337,"spent":270,"proposed":0},"FY2013":{"allotted":404,"spent":404,"proposed":0},"FY2014":{"allotted":404,"spent":404,"proposed":0},"FY2015":{"allotted":404,"spent":404,"proposed":0},"FY2016":{"allotted":411,"spent":403,"proposed":0},"FY2017":{"allotted":411,"spent":403,"proposed":0},"FY2018":{"allotted":411,"spent":403,"proposed":0},"FY2019":{"allotted":411,"spent":403,"proposed":0},"FY2020":{"allotted":411,"spent":403,"proposed":0},"FY2021":{"allotted":411,"spent":403,"proposed":0},"FY2022":{"allotted":411,"spent":403,"proposed":0}},"(03) Project Management":{"FY2011":{"allotted":993,"spent":986,"proposed":0},"FY2012":{"allotted":1433,"spent":1394,"proposed":124},"FY2013":{"allotted":1857,"spent":1748,"proposed":106},"FY2014":{"allotted":2682,"spent":2651,"proposed":250},"FY2015":{"allotted":2932,"spent":2904,"proposed":129},"FY2016":{"allotted":3061,"spent":2790,"proposed":250},"FY2017":{"allotted":3211,"spent":2676,"proposed":50},"FY2018":{"allotted":3261,"spent":2676,"proposed":0},"FY2019":{"allotted":3261,"spent":2676,"proposed":0},"FY2020":{"allotted":3261,"spent":2676,"proposed":250},"FY2021":{"allotted":3511,"spent":2676,"proposed":0},"FY2022":{"allotted":3511,"spent":2676,"proposed":50}},"(04) Construction":{"FY2011":{"allotted":2753,"spent":1950,"proposed":400},"FY2012":{"allotted":3317,"spent":2951,"proposed":276},"FY2013":{"allotted":3227,"spent":2951,"proposed":194},"FY2014":{"allotted":3301,"spent":2995,"proposed":0},"FY2015":{"allotted":3301,"spent":3201,"proposed":121},"FY2016":{"allotted":3422,"spent":3245,"proposed":0},"FY2017":{"allotted":3522,"spent":3238,"proposed":250},"FY2018":{"allotted":3772,"spent":3238,"proposed":300},"FY2019":{"allotted":4072,"spent":3238,"proposed":300},"FY2020":{"allotted":4372,"spent":3238,"proposed":50},"FY2021":{"allotted":4422,"spent":3238,"proposed":300},"FY2022":{"allotted":4722,"spent":3238,"proposed":250}}},"funding_by_source":{"Local Street Main (0330)":{"FY2011":{"allotted":3926,"spent":3183,"proposed":400}},"GO Bonds -
