Without the proper data sharing in place, government agencies often bear all costs associated with collecting, storing, and protecting data without realizing any noticeable benefits. The Citywide Data Warehouse’s (CityDW) mission is to democratize government data by providing a centralized access point for enterprise-wide data to agencies, employees and citizens. The focus is on providing real-time operational data from multiple agencies and sources to enable decision support and government transparency. To that extent, CityDW works with District agencies to supply both data and business intelligence tools. CityDW gathers data and builds reporting environments for agencies. CityDW also builds custom applications and dashboards to display the data. One example is the District’s Data Catalog and Data Feeds. For years the District of Columbia has provided public access to city operational data through the Internet. In 2004 the District started providing near real-time data from multiple agencies to citizens, to help agencies operate as more responsive, better performing organizations. The Data Catalog can be used to view or download a variety of data like crimes, service requests and procurements.","justification":"One of the significant achievements of the CityDW is that it leverages citizen participation in government in new ways. For example, for a limited investment of $50,000, the Apps For Democracy contest challenged anyone to utilize information available from CityDW’s data feeds. Local developers produced 47 applications that were conceived, developed, and delivered in 30 days (www.appsfordemocracy.org). By treating citizens as co-creators of government, the District secured software worth an estimated $2.6 million that the government alone would not have been able to create, particularly in this economic climate. The District has put seven of the applications in use since the contest concluded in November 2008.","progress_assessment":"CityDW now publishes over 200 datasets via the Data Catalog (http://data.octo.dc.gov/), and built four applications that are available to the public that make it easy to access and view data including crime and service requests on a map.","funding_by_phase":[{"prior_funding":{"Allotments":591,"Spent":565,"Enc/ID-Adv":26,"Pre-Enc":0,"Balance":0},"proposed_funding":{"FY2010":0,"FY2011":0,"FY2012":0,"FY2013":0,"FY2014":1162,"FY2015":1500},"phase":"(05) Equipment"},{"prior_funding":{"Allotments":2131,"Spent":175,"Enc/ID-Adv":1533,"Pre-Enc":87,"Balance":335},"proposed_funding":{"FY2010":850,"FY2011":713,"FY2012":1325,"FY2013":1350,"FY2014":0,"FY2015":0},"phase":"(07) IT Development & Testing"}],"funding_by_source":[{"prior_funding":{"Allotments":2722,"Spent":740,"Enc/ID-Adv":1559,"Pre-Enc":87,"Balance":335},"proposed_funding":{"FY2010":850,"FY2011":713,"FY2012":1325,"FY2013":1350,"FY2014":1162,"FY2015":1500},"source":"Equipment Lease (0302)"}],"milestones":{"environmental_approvals":{},"design_start":{"projected":"01/01/05","actual":"01/01/05"},"design_complete":{"projected":"12/01/05"},"construction_start":{"projected":"12/01/05","actual":"12/01/05"},"construction_complete":{},"closeout":{}},"related_projects":"The CityDW depends on other projects and systems to collect and send data.

These assets are also essential for the well-being of businesses, commuters, and pedestrians.     DDOT entered into a five-year performance-based contract with an electrical contractor to maintain the District’s lighting assets.  The contractor is responsible for managing all lighting assets within public space, including alleys and streetlights, highways, underpasses, tunnels, bridges, navigation lights, overhead guide signs, and “Welcome to Washington, DC” signs.  A number of lighting systems and the electrical control systems for the Frederick Douglas Bridge are also included.      In this performance-based asset preservation contract, the desired outcome is specified rather than the means and methods: the contractor is instructed what to achieve, not how to achieve it.  The District requires that the contractor meet a set of performance standards for all assets and DDOT personnel conduct citywide monthly and annual inspections to measure the contractor’s performance.  DDOT personnel also monitor the contractor’s response for repair requests and schedules daily.  The contract includes both incentives and disincentives for failing or exceeding these performance measures.

The interface with JUSTIS is designed to accept only specific data variables from the court, which are then transferred into the agency’s database and web application.  This data transfer system was designed in 2005, and provides for a daily transfer of individual case disposition and sentencing related data.  The Commission annually receives offender and offense related data from approximately 4,300 felony counts.  Data is initially transferred when a case disposition occurs and then updated when a sentence is imposed.  Thus, there are approximately 10,000 data transmissions from the court to the Commission annually.  This data has enabled the Commission to determine judicial compliance, analyze sentencing trends and evaluate the effectiveness of the sentencing guidelines.  It is from this data that the agency creates its Annual Reports, Issues Papers and responses to various data requests from criminal justice professionals.  Data analysis is the core function of the agency and it is the source of information from which modifications to the guidelines are developed and implemented as required in D.C. Code §3-101(b)(2)-(6).    DCSC will be implementing a new Integrated Justice Information System (IJIS) Outbound 12.1.  This will replace the RAM Server—the technology by which data from the court is now transferred—with the new IJIS Broker.  Currently, agencies pull data directly from the Agency Database; however, after the implementation of IJIS Outbound 12.1, agencies will pull data directly from JUSTIS and the agency database will cease to function as it is currently constructed.  In addition, JUSTIS will use an XML to facilitate a full data transfer from the court without any filtering.  The RAM Server and Agency Database are scheduled to be shut down six months after the IJIS Outbound 12.1 is fully implemented, which should tentatively occur in late 2012 or early 2013.  At that time, if agencies have not made the necessary changes to their respective data systems, they will no longer receive data from the court.    The Commission will be required to change its interface with JUSTIS to accept unfiltered data elements and transfer the data to a Staging Database from which the necessary and required data elements can be transferred to the agency’s database and web application.  Currently, the agency does not utilize a staging database and will need to construct one.  In addition, the amount of data available through IJIS Outbound 12.1 will increase significantly and the current agency web application was not constructed to process unfiltered data.  Further, changes will need to be made to the agency’s web application to utilize the additional data being provided.      If funding is not available to make the required changes to maintain compatibility with IJIS Outbound 12.1 and the Commission can no longer receive sentencing data from the court, the agency will be unable to meet any of its statutory duties.","progress_assessment":"N/A","funding_by_phase":[{"prior_funding":{"Allotments":0,"Spent":0,"Enc/ID-Adv":0,"Pre-Enc":0,"Balance":0},"proposed_funding":{"FY2013":800,"FY2014":0,"FY2015":0,"FY2016":0,"FY2017":0,"FY2018":0},"phase":"(07) IT Development & Testing"}],"funding_by_source":[{"prior_funding":{"Allotments":0,"Spent":0,"Enc/ID-Adv":0,"Pre-Enc":0,"Balance":0},"proposed_funding":{"FY2013":800,"FY2014":0,"FY2015":0,"FY2016":0,"FY2017":0,"FY2018":0},"source":"Equipment Lease (0302)"}],"milestones":{"environmental_approvals":{},"design_start":{},"design_complete":{},"construction_start":{},"construction_complete":{},"closeout":{}},"related_projects":"None","useful_life":10},{"cip_fy":13,"title":"BROOKLAND MS MODERNIZATION","image":null,"agency":"DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA PUBLIC SCHOOLS (GA0)","implementing_agency":"DEPARTMENT OF REAL ESTATE SERVICES (AM0)","project_no":"BRK37","ward":"5","location":"WASHINGTON DC","facility":"BROOKLAND MS","status":"New","est_cost":43732000,"description":"Re-opening of the existing Brookland ES, modernizing and transforming it into a new middle school.

CityDW gathers data and builds reporting environments for DCStat (http://capstat.oca.dc.gov/DC.aspx) and agencies like CFSA, DDOT, OUC (311 and 991 data).  CityDW also builds custom applications and dashboards to display the data like internal reporting and tracking tools like TrackDC (a public version will be released in FY10).   CityDW being the centralized location for a large amount of city data is also charged with making the data available to the public.  One example is the District’s Data Catalog that provides over 400 datasets in easy to access formats (spreadsheets Google Maps, Google Earth).  For years the District of Columbia has provided public access to city operational data through the Internet to help agencies operate as more responsive, better performing organizations.

The Southwest Library will be a destination that will attract and support hundreds of users per day, and promote a vibrant, mixed-use neighborhood and active street environment. A building condition assessment was conducted in 2001 and an additional building assessment was completed in December 2009. The 2001 report indicated numerous costly repairs and upgrades; this work has never been done in its entirety. The District continues to pay for ongoing maintenance issues. The building energy is inefficient.","justification":"The building is approximately 45 years old. The existing CMU masonry construction has limited flexibility to change within the existing walls of the building. As library use has changed over the years the need for electronic resources has expanded. However, expending the technology within the Southwest Library has proven extremely difficult.  The citizens living in Ward 6 will benefit from expanded library services much in the same way citizens in Wards 7 and 2 have benefited from their recently opened new libraries. The expanded library facilities and subsequent expanded library programs fits into the mayor’s educational priorities. This project aligns with Sustainable DC Action: Built Environment 3.5.","progress_assessment":"N/A","funding_by_phase":[{"prior_funding":{"Allotments":0,"Spent":0,"Enc/ID-Adv":0,"Pre-Enc":0,"Balance":0},"proposed_funding":{"FY2015":1850,"FY2016":0,"FY2017":0,"FY2018":0,"FY2019":0,"FY2020":0},"phase":"(01) Design"},{"prior_funding":{"Allotments":0,"Spent":0,"Enc/ID-Adv":0,"Pre-Enc":0,"Balance":0},"proposed_funding":{"FY2015":0,"FY2016":880,"FY2017":0,"FY2018":0,"FY2019":0,"FY2020":0},"phase":"(02) SITE"},{"prior_funding":{"Allotments":0,"Spent":0,"Enc/ID-Adv":0,"Pre-Enc":0,"Balance":0},"proposed_funding":{"FY2015":1700,"FY2016":1520,"FY2017":0,"FY2018":0,"FY2019":0,"FY2020":0},"phase":"(03) Project Management"},{"prior_funding":{"Allotments":0,"Spent":0,"Enc/ID-Adv":0,"Pre-Enc":0,"Balance":0},"proposed_funding":{"FY2015":0,"FY2016":10750,"FY2017":0,"FY2018":0,"FY2019":0,"FY2020":0},"phase":"(04) Construction"},{"prior_funding":{"Allotments":0,"Spent":0,"Enc/ID-Adv":0,"Pre-Enc":0,"Balance":0},"proposed_funding":{"FY2015":0,"FY2016":850,"FY2017":0,"FY2018":0,"FY2019":0,"FY2020":0},"phase":"(05) Equipment"}],"funding_by_source":[{"prior_funding":{"Allotments":0,"Spent":0,"Enc/ID-Adv":0,"Pre-Enc":0,"Balance":0},"proposed_funding":{"FY2015":3550,"FY2016":14000,"FY2017":0,"FY2018":0,"FY2019":0,"FY2020":0},"source":"Sales of Assets (0305)"}],"milestones":{"environmental_approvals":{},"design_start":{"projected":"10/01/10"},"design_complete":{"projected":"09/30/11"},"construction_start":{"projected":"01/02/11"},"construction_complete":{"projected":"06/15/18"},"closeout":{"projected":"08/15/18"}},"related_projects":"Mixed-use development is underway at the Southwest Waterfront.","useful_life":30},{"cip_fy":15,"title":"UI MODERNIZATION PROJECT-FEDERAL","image":null,"agency":"DEPARTMENT OF EMPLOYMENT SERVICES (CF0)","implementing_agency":"DEPARTMENT OF EMPLOYMENT SERVICES (CF0)","project_no":"UIM02","ward":"","location":"DISTRICT-WIDE","facility":"INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY","status":"Developing scope of work","est_cost":18000000,"description":"This project is focused on developing and deploying a fully integrated (Unemployment Benefits and Tax) robust solution resulting in efficiencies and the ability to offer broader services to the residents of the District of Columbia.

The interface with JUSTIS is designed to accept only specific data variables from the court, which are then transferred into the agency’s database and web application.  This data transfer system was designed in 2005, and provides for a daily transfer of individual case disposition and sentencing related data.  The Commission annually receives offender and offense related data from approximately 4,300 felony counts.  Data is initially transferred when a case disposition occurs and then updated when a sentence is imposed.  Thus, there are approximately 10,000 data transmissions from the court to the Commission annually.  This data has enabled the Commission to determine judicial compliance, analyze sentencing trends and evaluate the effectiveness of the sentencing guidelines.  It is from this data that the agency creates its Annual Reports, Issues Papers and responses to various data requests from criminal justice professionals.  Data analysis is the core function of the agency and it is the source of information from which modifications to the guidelines are developed and implemented as required in D.C. Code §3-101(b)(2)-(6).    DCSC will be implementing a new Integrated Justice Information System (IJIS) Outbound 12.1.  This will replace the RAM Server—the technology by which data from the court is now transferred—with the new IJIS Broker.  Currently, agencies pull data directly from the Agency Database; however, after the implementation of IJIS Outbound 12.1, agencies will pull data directly from JUSTIS and the agency database will cease to function as it is currently constructed.  In addition, JUSTIS will use an XML to facilitate a full data transfer from the court without any filtering.  The RAM Server and Agency Database are scheduled to be shut down six months after the IJIS Outbound 12.1 is fully implemented, which should tentatively occur in late 2012 or early 2013.  At that time, if agencies have not made the necessary changes to their respective data systems, they will no longer receive data from the court.    The Commission will be required to change its interface with JUSTIS to accept unfiltered data elements and transfer the data to a Staging Database from which the necessary and required data elements can be transferred to the agency’s database and web application.  Currently, the agency does not utilize a staging database and will need to construct one.  In addition, the amount of data available through IJIS Outbound 12.1 will increase significantly and the current agency web application was not constructed to process unfiltered data.  Further, changes will need to be made to the agency’s web application to utilize the additional data being provided.      If funding is not available to make the required changes to maintain compatibility with IJIS Outbound 12.1 and the Commission can no longer receive sentencing data from the court, the agency will be unable to meet any of its statutory duties.","progress_assessment":"N/A","funding_by_phase":[{"prior_funding":{"Allotments":845,"Spent":841,"Enc/ID-Adv":5,"Pre-Enc":0,"Balance":0},"proposed_funding":{"FY2015":425,"FY2016":0,"FY2017":0,"FY2018":0,"FY2019":0,"FY2020":0},"phase":"(07) IT Development & Testing"}],"funding_by_source":[{"prior_funding":{"Allotments":845,"Spent":841,"Enc/ID-Adv":5,"Pre-Enc":0,"Balance":0},"proposed_funding":{"FY2015":425,"FY2016":0,"FY2017":0,"FY2018":0,"FY2019":0,"FY2020":0},"source":"Equipment Lease (0302)"}],"milestones":{"environmental_approvals":{},"design_start":{},"design_complete":{},"construction_start":{},"construction_complete":{},"closeout":{}},"related_projects":"None","useful_life":10},{"cip_fy":15,"title":"ADA COMPLIANCE - DCPS","image":null,"agency":"DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA PUBLIC SCHOOLS (GA0)","implementing_agency":"DEPARTMENT OF GENERAL SERVICES (AM0)","project_no":"GM303","ward":"","location":"DISTRICT-WIDE","facility":"VARIOUS","status":"Ongoing Subprojects","est_cost":9413000,"description":"This stabilization initiative encompasses critical small capital ADA compliance modifications/mandates to ensure that school facilities can operate and support the academic needs of DCPS.","justification":"-","progress_assessment":"-","funding_by_phase":[{"prior_funding":{"Allotments":2413,"Spent":574,"Enc/ID-Adv":377,"Pre-Enc":175,"Balance":1286},"proposed_funding":{"FY2015":2000,"FY2016":2000,"FY2017":1000,"FY2018":0,"FY2019":1000,"FY2020":1000},"phase":"(04) Construction"}],"funding_by_source":[{"prior_funding":{"Allotments":2413,"Spent":574,"Enc/ID-Adv":377,"Pre-Enc":175,"Balance":1286},"proposed_funding":{"FY2015":2000,"FY2016":2000,"FY2017":1000,"FY2018":0,"FY2019":1000,"FY2020":1000},"source":"GO Bonds - New (0300)"}],"milestones":{"environmental_approvals":{"projected":"01/01/99"},"design_start":{"projected":"01/01/99"},"design_complete":{"projected":"01/01/99"},"construction_start":{"projected":"01/01/99"},"construction_complete":{"projected":"01/01/99"},"closeout":{"projected":"01/01/99"}},"related_projects":"-","useful_life":30},{"cip_fy":15,"title":"ADAMS ES MODERNIZATION/RENOVATION","image":"fy15-131_1.jpg","agency":"DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA PUBLIC SCHOOLS (GA0)","implementing_agency":"DEPARTMENT OF GENERAL SERVICES (AM0)","project_no":"YY160","ward":"1","location":"2000 19TH STREET NW","facility":"ADAMS ES","status":"In multiple phases","est_cost":14226000,"description":"The Adams ES Modernization project involves the modernization and renovation of this school using a systemic/phased approach consisting of more than one phase.

Schools need to have 100% wireless coverage in all teaching and administrative areas, and each classroom should have active network drops to support any device plugged into them (printers, PC's, interactive whiteboards, etc.).  Seventy schools have or will be modernized by the 2014 - 2015 school year. Thirty - three more schools desperately need new routers, new switches, power upgrades, cabling work and new wireless Access Points (AP's) installed to be modernized by the 2-15 - 2016 school year.

Since 2012 migrated and consolidated several District agencies (Department of Employment   Services, Department of Housing and Community Development, Child and Family Services   Agency, and Department of General Services) to the OCTO data centers, resulting in lower operational and maintenance costs, as these agencies no longer had to support and maintain their own disparate/silo datacenter.

In FY12 alone this effort has resulted in the decommissioning of three OCTO-operated data centers and migration of over 300 servers to OCTO's 'greener' data centers, resulting in a net savings for the District.","funding_by_phase":[{"prior_funding":{"Allotments":17040,"Spent":16322,"Enc/ID-Adv":41,"Pre-Enc":640,"Balance":37},"proposed_funding":{"FY2015":320,"FY2016":0,"FY2017":0,"FY2018":0,"FY2019":0,"FY2020":0},"phase":"(05) Equipment"}],"funding_by_source":[{"prior_funding":{"Allotments":17040,"Spent":16322,"Enc/ID-Adv":41,"Pre-Enc":640,"Balance":37},"proposed_funding":{"FY2015":320,"FY2016":0,"FY2017":0,"FY2018":0,"FY2019":0,"FY2020":0},"source":"Equipment Lease (0302)"}],"milestones":{"environmental_approvals":{},"design_start":{"projected":"10/01/08","actual":"10/01/08"},"design_complete":{"projected":"09/30/10","actual":"09/30/10"},"construction_start":{"projected":"09/30/09","actual":"08/17/09"},"construction_complete":{"projected":"12/31/21"},"closeout":{"projected":"09/30/20"}},"related_projects":"N9001C-DC Government New Data Center Build-out, N2201C - Server Consolidation, N2702C - Enterprise Messaging and Communications Platform, and N1705C - Information Infrastructure.","useful_life":15},{"cip_fy":15,"title":"DATA CENTER RELOCATION-GO BOND","image":null,"agency":"OFFICE OF CHIEF TECHNOLOGY OFFICER (TO0)","implementing_agency":"OFFICE OF CHIEF TECHNOLOGY OFFICER (TO0)","project_no":"N2503","ward":"8","location":"2720 MARTIN LUTHER KING JR., AVE","facility":"DATA CENTER","status":"Ongoing Subprojects","est_cost":7240000,"description":"The District of Columbia provides information technology services critical to public safety, public welfare, and government operations from its two primary data centers located within the District.

OCTO began converting the DC.Gov home page, agency websites and associated web portals to a new web platform that was more customer-centric and takes advantage of a number of Web 2.0 features such as social networking.  The conversion project would ultimately consolidate approximately 125 District websites into approximately 90 up-to-date websites with a new look and feel.     By the end of the first quarter of FY2011, 40 DC.Gov websites had been converted to the new web system, leaving approximately 50 agency sites to be migrated.   In the spring, OCTO made the decision to adopt a newer, more cost effective, open source web platform for all DC.Gov websites that will allow agency to post and share content quickly with greater ease.  By the end of FY11, OCTO had installed and configured the new, open source system, developed new content templates with an improved design, and launched OSSE’s new website.   In FY11 OCTO spent $376,872 of N3699C funds for a dedicated ITSA project team to set up the new Drupal platform from which OCTO would convert the remaining 50 agencies sites.   In FY12, OCTO spent $1,216,140 on the conversion 46 of the remaining 50 agencies sites, as well as launching a new mobile platform for DC.Gov.  In FY13, OCTO will migrate the 4 legacy sites plus 40 websites that were originally moved to the web system that was ultimately replaced by the open source system.","funding_by_phase":[{"prior_funding":{"Allotments":1500,"Spent":115,"Enc/ID-Adv":600,"Pre-Enc":0,"Balance":785},"proposed_funding":{"FY2015":1500,"FY2016":0,"FY2017":0,"FY2018":0,"FY2019":0,"FY2020":0},"phase":"(04) Construction"},{"prior_funding":{"Allotments":4849,"Spent":4831,"Enc/ID-Adv":27,"Pre-Enc":0,"Balance":9},"proposed_funding":{"FY2015":0,"FY2016":0,"FY2017":0,"FY2018":0,"FY2019":0,"FY2020":0},"phase":"(06) IT Requirements Development/Systems Design"}],"funding_by_source":[{"prior_funding":{"Allotments":6349,"Spent":4946,"Enc/ID-Adv":628,"Pre-Enc":0,"Balance":776},"proposed_funding":{"FY2015":1500,"FY2016":0,"FY2017":0,"FY2018":0,"FY2019":0,"FY2020":0},"source":"GO Bonds - New (0300)"}],"milestones":{"environmental_approvals":{},"design_start":{},"design_complete":{},"construction_start":{},"construction_complete":{},"closeout":{"projected":"12/31/21"}},"related_projects":"None","useful_life":5},{"cip_fy":15,"title":"SERVER CONSOLIDATION","image":null,"agency":"OFFICE OF CHIEF TECHNOLOGY OFFICER (TO0)","implementing_agency":"EQUIPMENT LEASE - CAPITAL (ELC)","project_no":"N2201","ward":"","location":"DISTRICT-WIDE","facility":"DATA CENTER","status":"Ongoing Subprojects","est_cost":4248000,"description":"District agencies’ technology needs increasingly require additional servers to host applications within the two OCTO Data Centers.

The original building was constructed in 1923, with additions constructed in 1932, 1938, 1961, and 1973. Although the buildings are adjoining, they consist of various misaligned levels and present a number of operational challenges.The project at hand is intended to make the various buildings on campus more unified both operationally and administratively. To achieve this goal demolition and rebuilding of some of the buildings is necessary. Existing buildings that are not demolished will be renovated and provided with features such as ramps and elevators that improve the lateral and vertical transport between the buildings.Additionally the project will provide spaces in line with the program requirements set in the DCPS Educational Specifications.  Accordingly besides classrooms, spaces such as Media Center, Indoor Play, Auditorium, and Art Room will be provided. The program for Bria, an associated but independent operation with a Parents' Center, will also receive a portion of the space allocation. The Electrical, Mechanical and Life Safety systems of the entire building will be upgraded to meet the current building code requirements and the Ed Specifications performance requirements.It is anticipated that some level of swing space will be required in order to accommodate students temporarily displaced by the Project. The modernized campus will serve approximately 550 students. The Project shall be designed in such a way as to achieve, at a minimum, LEED for Schools - Gold Certification.","justification":"This project was included in the Master Facilities Plan adopted by Section 4111 of the Fiscal Year 2011 Budget Support Act of 2010.

The environmental standards of the sites will address a plethora of problems such as the storm water management crisis perpetuated in part by the vast expanse of DCPS hardscape. Under this aspect of the project, schoolyards will retain a much greater percentage of storm-water runoff and help mitigate the need for the city to invest in other abatement initiatives.
